In this paper we summarize the experiences gained from a field trial of a speaker verification system. In the test implementation access to two rooms at the University of Frankfurt had been controlled by a speaker verification system. The paper is organized as follows: Firstly, we will describe the system concepts and implementation issues. Secondly, results of the user evaluation are reported. During the field trial all speech data was recorded. The data base created in this way has been used extensively for simulation experiments. In chapter 4 we will describe recent experiments focusing on the use of Hidden Markov Models.
