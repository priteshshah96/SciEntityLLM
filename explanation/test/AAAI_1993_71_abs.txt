In this paper we investigate the simple logical properties of contexts. We describe both the syntax and semantics of a general propositional language of context, and give a Hilbert style proof system for this language. A propositional logic of context extends classical propositional logic in two ways. Firstly, a new modality, ist(;), is introduced. It is used to express that the sentence, , holds in the context. Secondly, each context has its own vocabulary, i.e. a set of propositional atoms which are deened or meaningful in that context. The main results of this paper are the sound-ness and completeness of this Hilbert style proof system. We also provide soundness and completeness results (i.e. correspondence theory) for various extensions of the general system.
