We present a single-image highlight removal method that incorporates illumination-based constraints into image in-painting. Unlike occluded image regions filled by traditional inpainting, highlight pixels contain some useful information for guiding the inpainting process. Constraints provided by observed pixel colors, highlight color analysis and illumination color uniformity are employed in our method to improve estimation of the underlying diffuse color. The inclusion of these illumination constraints allows for better recovery of shading and textures by inpainting. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the performance of our method.
