Text: "Color is known to be highly discriminative for many object recognition tasks, but is difficult to infer from uncontrolled images in which the illuminant is not known. Traditional methods for color constancy can improve surface re-flectance estimates from such uncalibrated images, but their output depends significantly on the background scene. In many recognition and retrieval applications, we have access to image sets that contain multiple views of the same object in different environments; we show in this paper that correspondences between these images provide important constraints that can improve color constancy. We introduce the multi-view color constancy problem, and present a method to recover estimates of underlying surface re-flectance based on joint estimation of these surface properties and the illuminants present in multiple images. The method can exploit image correspondences obtained by various alignment techniques, and we show examples based on matching local region features. Our results show that multi-view constraints can significantly improve estimates of both scene illuminants and object color (surface reflectance) when compared to a baseline single-view method."

Text: "This paper presents an algorithm for computing optical flow, shape, motion, lighting, and albedo from an image sequence of a rigidly-moving Lambertian object under distant illumination. The problem is formulated in a manner that subsumes structure from motion, multi-view stereo, and photo-metric stereo as special cases. The algorithm utilizes both spatial and temporal intensity variation as cues: the former constrains flow and the latter constrains surface orientation ; combining both cues enables dense reconstruction of both textured and texture-less surfaces. The algorithm works by iteratively estimating affine camera parameters, illumination , shape, and albedo in an alternating fashion. Results are demonstrated on videos of hand-held objects moving in front of a fixed light and camera."

Text: "In this paper, we improve an unsupervised learning method using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by Nigam et al. for text classification problems in order to apply it to word sense disambiguation (WSD) problems. The improved method stops the EM algorithm at the optimum iteration number. To estimate that number, we propose two methods. In experiments, we solved 50 noun WSD problems in the Japanese Dictionary Task in SENSEVAL2. The score of our method is a match for the best public score of this task. Furthermore, our methods were confirmed to be effective also for verb WSD problems."
