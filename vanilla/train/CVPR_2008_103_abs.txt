In this paper, we propose a partially-blurred-image classification and analysis framework for automatically detecting images containing blurred regions and recognizing the blur types for those regions without needing to perform blur kernel estimation and image deblurring. We develop several blur features modeled by image color, gradient, and spectrum information, and use feature parameter training to robustly classify blurred images. Our blur detection is based on image patches, making region-wise training and classification in one image efficient. Extensive experiments show that our method works satisfactorily on challenging image data, which establishes a technical foundation for solving several computer vision problems, such as motion analysis and image restoration, using the blur information.
