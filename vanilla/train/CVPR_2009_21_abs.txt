Many computer vision applications, such as image classification and video indexing, are usually multi-label classification problems in which an instance can be assigned to more than one category. In this paper, we present a novel multi-label classification approach with hypergraph regu-larization that addresses the correlations among different categories. First, a hypergraph is constructed to capture the correlations among different categories, in which each vertex represents one training instance and each hyperedge for one category contains all the instances belonging to the same category. Then, an improved SVM like learning system incorporating the hypergraph regularization, called Rank-HLapSVM, is proposed to handle the multi-label classification problems. We find that the corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the dual coordinate descent method. Many promising experimental results on the real datasets including ImageCLEF and Me-diaMill demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
