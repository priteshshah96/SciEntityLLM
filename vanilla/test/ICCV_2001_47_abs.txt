We propose to incorporate a priori geometric constraints in a 3–D stereo reconstruction scheme to cope with the many cases where image information alone is not sufficient to accurately recover 3–D shape. Our approach is based on the iterative deformation of a 3–D surface mesh to minimize an objective function. We show that combining anisotropic meshing with a non-quadratic approach to regularization enables us to obtain satisfactory reconstruction results using triangulations with few vertices. Structural or numerical constraints can then be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme. They improve the reconstruction results and enforce their consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape. The strong description and modeling properties of differential features make them useful tools that can be efficiently used as constraints for 3–D reconstruction .
