Fast algorithms for nearest neighbor (NN) search have in large part focused on 2 distance. Here we develop an approach for 1 distance that begins with an explicit and exactly distance-preserving embedding of the points into 2 2. We show how this can efficiently be combined with random-projection based methods for 2 NN search, such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or random projection trees. We rigorously establish the correctness of the methodology and show by experimentation using LSH that it is competitive in practice with available alternatives.
