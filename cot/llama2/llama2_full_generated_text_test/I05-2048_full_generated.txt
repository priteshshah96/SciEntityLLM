The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "  Statistical machine translation (SMT)  is currently one of the hot spots in  natural language processing  . Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of comparative evaluations have shown, that  SMT  gives competitive results to  rule-based translation systems  , requiring significantly less development time. This is particularly important when building  translation systems  for new  language pairs  or new  domains  . This workshop is intended to give an introduction to  statistical machine translation  with a focus on practical considerations. Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an  SMT system  themselves and achieving good  baseline results  in a short time. The tutorial will cover the basics of  SMT  : Theory will be put into practice.  STTK  , a  statistical machine translation tool kit  , will be introduced and used to build a working  translation system  .  STTK  has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of  CMU's SMT system  . It has also successfully been coupled with  rule-based and example based machine translation modules  to build a  multi engine machine translation system  . The  source code  of the  tool kit  will be made available. "
