Within the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL, a challenge was organized to design a statistical machine learning algorithm that segments words into the smallest meaning-bearing units of language , morphemes. Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as speech and text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval, and statistical language modeling. Twelve research groups participated in the challenge and had submitted segmentation results obtained by their algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the application of these segmen-tation algorithms to large vocabulary speech recognition using statistical n-gram language models based on the proposed word segments instead of entire words. Experiments were done for two ag-glutinative and morphologically rich languages: Finnish and Turk-ish. We also investigate combining various segmentations to improve the performance of the recognizer.
