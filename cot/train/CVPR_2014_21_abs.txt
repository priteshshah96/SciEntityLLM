In this paper we present a novel autonomous pipeline to build a personalized parametric model (pose-driven avatar) using a single depth sensor. Our method first captures a few high-quality scans of the user rotating herself at multiple poses from different views. We fit each incomplete scan using template fitting techniques with a generic human template, and register all scans to every pose using global consistency constraints. After registration, these watertight models with different poses are used to train a parametric model in a fashion similar to the SCAPE method. Once the parametric model is built, it can be used as an anim-itable avatar or more interestingly synthesizing dynamic 3D models from single-view depth videos. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system to produce dynamic models.
