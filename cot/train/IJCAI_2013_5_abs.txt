Constraint propagation is one of the key techniques in constraint programming, and a large body of work has built up around it. Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports â€” by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support (a justification that a variable-value pair still forms part of a solution to the constraint) for all other variables and values and save substantial work. Recently short supports have been used in general purpose prop-agators, and (when the constraint is amenable to short supports) speed ups of more than three orders of magnitude have been demonstrated. In this paper we present SHORTSTR2, a development of the Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2+. We show that SHORTSTR2 is complementary to the existing algorithms SHORTGAC and HAGGISGAC that exploit short supports, while being much simpler. When a constraint is amenable to short supports, the short support set can be exponentially smaller than the full-length support set. Therefore SHORTSTR2 can efficiently propagate many constraints that STR2+ cannot even load into memory. We also show that SHORTSTR2 can be combined with a simple algorithm to identify short supports from full-length supports, to provide a superior drop-in replacement for STR2+.
