We investigated whether automatic phonetic transcriptions (APTs) can replace manually verified phonetic transcriptions (MPTs) in a large corpus-based study on pronunciation variation. To this end, we compared the performance of both transcription types in a classification experiment aimed at establishing the direct influence of a particular situational setting on pronunciation variation. We trained classifiers on the speech processes extracted from the alignments of an APT and an MPT with a canonical transcription. We tested whether the classifiers were equally good at verifying whether unknown transcriptions represent read speech or telephone dialogues, and whether the same speech processes were identified to distinguish between transcriptions of the two situational settings. Our results not only show that similar distinguishing speech processes were identified; our APT-based classifier yielded better classification accuracy than the MPT-based classifier whilst using fewer classification features.
