We present an image set classification algorithm based on unsupervised clustering of labeled training and unla-beled test data where labels are only used in the stopping criterion. The probability distribution of each class over the set of clusters is used to define a true set based similarity measure. To this end, we propose an iterative sparse spectral clustering algorithm. In each iteration, a proximity matrix is efficiently recomputed to better represent the local subspace structure. Initial clusters capture the global data structure and finer clusters at the later stages capture the subtle class differences not visible at the global scale. Image sets are compactly represented with multiple Grass-mannian manifolds which are subsequently embedded in Euclidean space with the proposed spectral clustering algorithm. We also propose an efficient eigenvector solver which not only reduces the computational cost of spectral clustering by many folds but also improves the clustering quality and final classification results. Experiments on five standard datasets and comparison with seven existing techniques show the efficacy of our algorithm.
