Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
 This paper reports on two contributions to  large vocabulary continuous speech recognition  . First, we present a new paradigm for  speaker-independent (SI) training  of  hidden Markov models (HMM)  , which uses a large amount of  speech  from a few  speakers  instead of the traditional practice of using a little  speech  from many  speakers  . In addition, combination of the  training speakers  is done by averaging the  statistics  of  independently trained models  rather than the usual pooling of all the  speech data  from many  speakers  prior to  training  . With only 12  training speakers  for  SI recognition  , we achieved a 7.5%  word error rate  on a standard  grammar  and  test set  from the  DARPA Resource Management corpus  . This  performance  is comparable to our best condition for this test suite, using 109  training speakers  . Second, we show a significant improvement for  speaker adaptation (SA)  using the new  SI corpus  and a small amount of  speech  from the new (target)  speaker  . A  probabilistic spectral mapping  is estimated independently for each  training (reference) speaker  and the  target speaker  . Each  reference model  is transformed to the  space  of the  target speaker  and combined by  averaging  . Using only 40  utterances  from the  target speaker  for  adaptation  , the  error rate  dropped to 4.1% --- a 45% reduction in error compared to the  SI  result. "
