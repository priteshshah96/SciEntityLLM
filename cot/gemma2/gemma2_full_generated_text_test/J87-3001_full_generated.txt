Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper shows how  dictionary word sense definitions  can be analysed by applying a hierarchy of  phrasal patterns . An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing  definitions  from the  Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English . A property of this  dictionary , exploited by the system, is that it uses a  restricted vocabulary  in its  word sense definitions . The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the  classification  of new  word senses  in terms of the  senses  of  words  in the  restricted vocabulary . Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific  phrasal analysis rules  as determined by a hierarchy of  patterns  in which less specific  patterns  dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the  definitions  are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust  analysis mechanism . Thus the work reported addresses two  robustness problems  faced by current experimental  natural language processing systems : coping with an incomplete  lexicon  and with incomplete  knowledge  of  phrasal constructions .
