Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing  probabilistic parser  . The base  parser  produces a set of  candidate parses  for each input  sentence  , with associated  probabilities  that define an initial  ranking  of these  parses  . A second  model  then attempts to improve upon this initial  ranking  , using additional  features  of the  tree  as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a  tree  to be represented as an arbitrary set of  features  , without concerns about how these  features  interact or overlap and without the need to define a  derivation  or a  generative model  which takes these  features  into account . We introduce a new method for the  reranking task  , based on the  boosting approach  to  ranking problems  described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the  boosting method  to  parsing  the  Wall Street Journal treebank  . The method combined the  log-likelihood  under a  baseline model  (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000  features  over  parse trees  that were not included in the original  model  . The new  model  achieved 89.75%  F-measure  , a 13% relative decrease in  F-measure  error over the  baseline model's score  of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the  boosting approach  which takes advantage of the  sparsity of the feature space  in the  parsing data  . Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious  implementation  of the  boosting approach  . We argue that the method is an appealing alternative - in terms of both simplicity and efficiency - to work on  feature selection methods  within  log-linear (maximum-entropy) models  . Although the experiments in this article are on  natural language parsing (NLP)  , the approach should be applicable to many other  NLP problems  which are naturally framed as  ranking tasks  , for example,  speech recognition  ,  machine translation  , or  natural language generation  .
