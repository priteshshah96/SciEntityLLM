2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper we introduce Ant-Q, a family of algorithms which present many similarities with Q-learning (Watkins, 1989), and which we apply to the solution of symmetric and asym-metric instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Ant-Q algorithms were inspired by work on the ant system (AS), a distributed algorithm for combinatorial optimization based on the metaphor of ant colonies which was recently proposed in (Dorigo, 1992; Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1996). We show that AS is a particular instance of the Ant-Q family, and that there are instances of this family which perform better than AS. We experimentally investigate the functioning of Ant-Q and we show that the results obtained by Ant-Q on symmetric TSP's are competitive with those obtained by other heuristic approaches based on neural networks or local search. Finally, we apply Ant-Q to some difficult asymmetric TSP's obtaining very good results: Ant-Q was able to find solutions of a quality which usually can be found only by very specialized algorithms."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 Statistical language modeling  remains a challenging task, in particular for  morphologically rich languages . Recently, new approaches based on  factored language models  have been developed to address this problem. These  models  provide principled ways of including additional  conditioning variables  other than the  preceding words , such as  morphological or syntactic features . However, the number of possible choices for  model parameters  creates a  large space of models  that cannot be searched exhaustively. This paper presents an  entirely data-driven model selection procedure  based on  genetic search , which is shown to outperform both  knowledge-based and random selection procedures  on two different  language modeling tasks  ( Arabic  and  Turkish ).

This gives a set of bases which not only allows a non-subtractive (part-based) representation of images but also manifests localized features. An algorithm is presented for the learning of such basis components. Experimental results are presented to compare LNMF with the NMF and PCA methods for face representation and recognition, which demonstrates advantages of LNMF."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
With performance above 97%  accuracy  for  newspaper text ,  part of speech (pos) tagging  might be considered a solved problem. Previous studies have shown that allowing the  parser  to resolve  pos tag ambiguity  does not improve performance. However, for  grammar formalisms  which use more  fine-grained grammatical categories , for example  tag  and  ccg ,  tagging accuracy  is much lower. In fact, for these  formalisms , premature  ambiguity resolution  makes  parsing  infeasible. We describe a  multi-tagging approach  which maintains a suitable level of  lexical category ambiguity  for accurate and efficient  ccg parsing . We extend this  multi-tagging approach  to the  pos level  to overcome errors introduced by automatically assigned  pos tags . Although  pos tagging accuracy  seems high, maintaining some  pos tag ambiguity  in the  language processing pipeline  results in more accurate  ccg supertagging .

Text: "LPC based speech coders operating at bit rates below 3.0 kbits/sec are usually associated with buzzy or metallic artefacts in the synthetic speech. These are mainly attributable to the simplifying assumptions made about the excitation source, which are usually required to maintain such low bit rates. In this paper a new LPC vocoder is presented which splits the LPC excitation into two frequency bands using a variable cutoff frequency. The lower band is responsible for representing the voiced parts of speech, whilst the upper band represents unvoiced speech. In doing so the coder's performance during both mixed voicing speech and speech containing acoustic noise is greatly improved, producing soft natural sounding speech. The paper also describes new parameter determination and quantisation techniques vital to the operation of this coder at such low bit rates."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
In this paper, we show how to construct a  transfer dictionary  automatically.  Dictionary construction , one of the most difficult tasks in developing a  machine translation system , is expensive. To avoid this problem, we investigate how we build a  dictionary  using existing  linguistic resources . Our  algorithm  can be applied to any  language pairs , but for the present we focus on building a  Korean-to-Japanese dictionary  using  English  as a  pivot . We attempt three ways of  automatic construction  to corroborate the effect of the  directionality  of  dictionaries . First, we introduce  "one-time look up" method  using a  Korean-to-English and a Japanese-to-English dictionary . Second, we show a method using  "overlapping constraint"  with a  Korean-to-English dictionary  and an  English-to-Japanese dictionary . Third, we consider another alternative method rarely used for building a  dictionary : an  English-to-Korean dictionary  and  English-to-Japanese dictionary . We found that the first method is the most effective and the best result can be obtained from combining the three methods.

Text: "We previously presented a framework for segmentation of complex scenes using multiple physical hypotheses for simple image regions. A consequence of that framework was a proposal for a new approach to the segmentation of complex scenes into regions corresponding to coherent surfaces rather than merely regions of similar color. Herein we present an implementation of this new approach and show example segmentations for scenes containing multi-colored piece-wise uniform objects. Using our approach we are able to intelligently segment scenes with objects of greater complexity than previous physics-based segmentation algorithms. The results show that by using general physical models we obtain segmentations that correspond more closely to coherent surfaces in the scene than segmentations found using only color."

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

Text: " We present the first known  empirical test  of an increasingly common speculative claim, by evaluating a representative  Chinese-to-English SMT model  directly on  word sense disambiguation performance  , using standard  WSD evaluation methodology  and  datasets  from the  Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task  . Much effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated  word sense disambiguation (WSD) models  , in particular with the  Senseval  series of workshops. At the same time, the recent improvements in the  BLEU scores  of  statistical machine translation (SMT)  suggests that  SMT models  are good at predicting the right  translation  of the  words  in  source language sentences  . Surprisingly however, the  WSD   accuracy  of  SMT models  has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated  WSD models  . We present controlled experiments showing the  WSD   accuracy  of current typical  SMT models  to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated  WSD models  considered. This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current  SMT models  do have limitations in comparison with dedicated  WSD models  , and that  SMT  should benefit from the better predictions made by the  WSD models  .

Text: "
Reducing  language model (LM) size  is a critical issue when applying a  LM  to realistic applications which have memory constraints. In this paper, three measures are studied for the purpose of  LM pruning . They are probability,  rank , and  entropy . We evaluated the performance of the three  pruning criteria  in a real application of  Chinese text input  in terms of  character error rate (CER) . We first present an empirical comparison, showing that  rank  performs the best in most cases. We also show that the high-performance of  rank  lies in its strong correlation with  error rate . We then present a novel method of combining two criteria in  model pruning . Experimental results show that the combined criterion consistently leads to smaller models than the models pruned using either of the criteria separately, at the same  CER .

Text: "Probabilistic models have been previously shown to be efficient and effective for modeling and recognition of human motion. In particular we focus on methods which represent the human motion model as a triangulated graph. Previous approaches learned models based just on positions and velocities of the body parts while ignoring their appearance. Moreover, a heuristic approach was commonly used to obtain translation invariance. In this paper we suggest an improved approach for learning such models and using them for human motion recognition. The suggested approach combines multiple cues, i.e., positions, velocities and appearance into both the learning and detection phases. Furthermore, we introduce global variables in the model, which can represent global properties such as translation, scale or viewpoint. The model is learned in an unsupervised manner from un-labelled data. We show that the suggested hybrid proba-bilistic model (which combines global variables, like translation , with local variables, like relative positions and appearances of body parts), leads to: (i) faster convergence of learning phase, (ii) robustness to occlusions, and, (iii) higher recognition rate."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
Existing techniques extract  term candidates  by looking for  internal and contextual information  associated with  domain specific terms . The algorithms always face the dilemma that fewer  features  are not enough to distinguish  terms  from  non-terms  whereas more  features  lead to more conflicts among selected  features . This paper presents a novel approach for  term extraction  based on  delimiters  which are much more stable and domain independent. The proposed approach is not as sensitive to  term frequency  as that of previous works. This approach has no strict limit or  hard rules  and thus they can deal with all kinds of  terms . It also requires no prior  domain knowledge  and no additional  training  to adapt to new  domains . Consequently, the proposed approach can be applied to different  domains  easily and it is especially useful for  resource-limited domains . Evaluations conducted on two different  domains  for  Chinese term extraction  show significant improvements over existing techniques which verifies its efficiency and domain independent nature. Experiments on  new term extraction  indicate that the proposed approach can also serve as an effective tool for  domain lexicon expansion .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Face images of non-frontal views under poor illumination with low resolution reduce dramatically face recognition accuracy. This is evident most compellingly by the very low recognition rate of all existing face recognition systems when applied to live CCTV camera input. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework to perform multi-modal (such as variations in viewpoint and illumination) face image super-resolution for recognition in tensor space. Given a single modal low-resolution face image, we benefit from the multiple factor interactions of training tensor, and super-resolve its high-resolution reconstructions across different modalities for face recognition. Instead of performing pixel-domain super-resolution and recognition independently as two separate sequential processes, we integrate the tasks of super-resolution and recognition by directly computing a maximum likelihood identity parameter vector in high-resolution tensor space for recognition. We show results from multi-modal super-resolution and face recognition experiments across different imaging modalities, using low-resolution images as testing inputs and demonstrate improved recognition rates over standard tensorface and eigenface representations."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 Terminology structuring  has been the subject of much work in the context of  terms  extracted from  corpora : given a set of  terms , obtained from an existing resource or extracted from a  corpus , identifying  hierarchical (or other types of) relations  between these  terms . The present paper focusses on  terminology structuring  by  lexical methods , which match  terms  on the basis on their  content words , taking  morphological variants  into account. Experiments are done on a 'flat' list of  terms  obtained from an originally  hierarchically-structured terminology : the French version of the  US National Library of Medicine MeSH thesaurus . We compare the  lexically-induced relations  with the original  MeSH relations : after a quantitative evaluation of their congruence through  recall and precision metrics , we perform a qualitative, human analysis ofthe 'new'  relations  not present in the  MeSH . This analysis shows, on the one hand, the limits of the  lexical structuring method . On the other hand, it also reveals some specific structuring choices and  naming conventions  made by the  MeSH  designers, and emphasizes ontological commitments that cannot be left to  automatic structuring .

In this paper, we focus on the minimal labeling problem (MLP) and we propose an algorithm to efficiently derive all the feasible base relations of a QCN. Our algorithm considers chordal QCNs and a new form of partial consistency which we define as ◆ G-consistency. Further, the proposed algorithm uses tractable subclasses of relations having a specific patchwork property for which-consistency implies the consistency of the input QCN. Experi-mentations with QCNs of IA and RCC-8 show the importance and efficiency of this new approach."

Text: "Background maintenance is a frequent element of video surveillance systems. We develop Wallflower, a three-component system for background maintenance: the pixel-level component performs Wiener filtering to make probabilistic predictions of the expected background; the region-level component fills in homogeneous regions of foreground objects; and the frame-level component detects sudden, global changes in the image and swaps in better approximations of the background. We compare our system with 8 other background subtraction algorithms. Wallflower is shown to outperform previous algorithms by handling a greater set of the difficult situations that can occur. Finally, we analyze the experimental results and propose normative principles for background maintenance."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "
 Lyric-based song sentiment classification  seeks to assign songs appropriate  sentiment labels  such as light-hearted heavy-hearted. Four problems render  vector space model (VSM)-based text classification approach  ineffective: 1) Many  words  within  song lyrics  actually contribute little to  sentiment ; 2)  Nouns  and  verbs  used to express  sentiment  are ambiguous; 3)  Negations  and  modifiers  around the  sentiment keywords  make particular contributions to  sentiment ; 4)  Song lyric  is usually very short. To address these problems, the  sentiment vector space model (s-VSM)  is proposed to represent  song lyric document . The preliminary experiments prove that the  s-VSM model  outperforms the  VSM model  in the  lyric-based song sentiment classification task .

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 Interpreting  metaphors  is an integral and inescapable process in  human understanding of natural language  . This paper discusses a  method of analyzing metaphors  based on the existence of a small number of  generalized metaphor mappings  . Each  generalized metaphor  contains a  recognition network  , a  basic mapping  , additional  transfer mappings  , and an  implicit intention component  . It is argued that the method reduces  metaphor interpretation  from a  reconstruction  to a  recognition task  . Implications towards automating certain aspects of  language learning  are also discussed. "

Text: "
In this study, we propose a  knowledge-independent method  for aligning  terms  and thus extracting  translations  from a  small, domain-specific corpus  consisting of  parallel English and Chinese court judgments  from Hong Kong. With a  sentence-aligned corpus ,  translation equivalences  are suggested by analysing the  frequency profiles  of  parallel concordances . The method overcomes the limitations of  conventional statistical methods  which require  large corpora  to be effective, and  lexical approaches  which depend on existing  bilingual dictionaries . Pilot testing on a  parallel corpus  of about 113K  Chinese words  and 120K  English words  gives an encouraging 85%  precision  and 45%  recall . Future work includes fine-tuning the  algorithm  upon the analysis of the errors, and acquiring a  translation lexicon  for  legal terminology  by filtering out  general terms .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "When classifying high-dimensional sequence data, traditional methods (e.g., HMMs, CRFs) may require large amounts of training data to avoid overfitting. In such cases dimensionality reduction can be employed to find a low-dimensional representation on which classification can be done more efficiently. Existing methods for supervised dimensionality reduction often presume that the data is densely sampled so that a neighborhood graph structure can be formed, or that the data arises from a known distribution. Sufficient dimension reduction techniques aim to find a low dimensional representation such that the remaining degrees of freedom become conditionally independent of the output values. In this paper we develop a novel sequence kernel dimension reduction approach (S-KDR). Our approach does not make strong assumptions on the distribution of the input data. Spatial, temporal and periodic information is combined in a principled manner, and an optimal manifold is learned for the end-task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several tasks involving the discrimination of human gesture and motion categories, as well as on a database of dynamic textures."

Text: "In this paper, we propose a human action recognition system suitable for embedded computer vision applications in security systems, human-computer interaction and intelligent environments. Our system is suitable for embedded computer vision application based on three reasons. Firstly, the system was based on a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier where classification progress can be implemented easily and quickly in embedded hardware. Secondly , we use compacted motion features easily obtained from videos. We address the limitations of the well known Motion History Image (MHI) and propose a new Hierarchical Motion History Histogram (HMHH) feature to represent the motion information. HMHH not only provides rich motion information, but also remains computationally inexpensive. Finally, we combine MHI and HMHH together and extract a low dimension feature vector to be used in the SVM classifiers. Experimental results show that our system achieves significant improvement on the recognition performance ."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "The Rete and Treat algorithms are considered the most efficient implementation techniques for Forward Chaining rule systems. These algorithms support a language of limited expressive power. Assertions are not allowed to contain variables, making universal quantification impossible to express except as a rule. In this paper we show how to support full unification in these algorithms. We also show that: Supporting full unification is costly; Full unification is not used frequently; A combination of compile time and run time checks can determine when full unification is not needed. We present data to show that the cost of supporting full unification can be reduced in proportion to the degree that it isn't employed and that for many practical systems this cost is negligible."

It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

Two themes have evolved in  speech and text image processing  work at  Xerox PARC  that expand and redefine the role of  recognition technology  in  document-oriented applications . One is the development of systems that provide functionality similar to that of  text processors  but operate directly on  audio and scanned image data . A second, related theme is the use of  speech and text-image recognition  to retrieve arbitrary, user-specified information from  documents with signal content . This paper discusses three research initiatives at  PARC  that exemplify these themes: a  text-image editor [1], a  wordspotter  for  voice editing and indexing [12], and a  decoding framework  for  scanned-document content retrieval [4].

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper describes an  unsupervised learning method  for  associative relationships between verb phrases , which is important in developing reliable  Q&A systems . Consider the situation that a user gives a  query  "How much petrol was imported to Japan from Saudi Arabia?" to a  Q&A system , but the  text  given to the system includes only the  description  "X tonnes of petrol was conveyed to Japan from Saudi Arabia". We think that the  description  is a good clue to find the answer for our  query , "X tonnes". But there is no  large-scale database  that provides the  associative relationship  between "imported" and "conveyed". Our aim is to develop an  unsupervised learning method  that can obtain such an  associative relationship , which we call  scenario consistency . The method we are currently working on uses an  expectation-maximization (EM) based word-clustering algorithm , and we have evaluated the effectiveness of this method using  Japanese verb phrases .

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD).

Text: " 
 In this paper, a discrimination and robustness oriented  adaptive learning procedure  is proposed to deal with the task of  syntactic ambiguity resolution  . Owing to the problem of  insufficient training data  and  approximation error  introduced by the  language model  , traditional  statistical approaches  , which resolve  ambiguities  by indirectly and implicitly using  maximum likelihood method  , fail to achieve high  performance  in real applications. The proposed method remedies these problems by adjusting the parameters to maximize the  accuracy rate  directly. To make the proposed algorithm robust, the possible variations between the  training corpus  and the real tasks are also taken into consideration by enlarging the  separation margin  between the correct candidate and its competing members. Significant improvement has been observed in the test. The  accuracy rate  of  syntactic disambiguation  is raised from 46.0% to 60.62% by using this novel approach. "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "We study and compare two novel embedding methods for segmenting feature points of piece-wise planar structures from two (uncalibrated) perspective images. We show that a set of different homographies can be embedded in different ways to a higher-dimensional real or complex space, so that each homography corresponds to either a complex bilinear form or a real quadratic form. Each embedding reveals different algebraic properties and relations of homo-graphies. We give a closed-form segmentation solution for each case by utilizing these properties based on subspace-segmentation methods. These theoretical results show that one can intrinsically segment a piece-wise planar scene from 2-D images without explicitly performing any 3-D reconstruction. The resulting segmentation may make subsequent 3-D reconstruction much better-conditioned. We demonstrate the proposed methods with some convincing experimental results."

Text: "Identity uncertainty is a pervasive problem in real-world data analysis. It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identifiers or when those identifiers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two observations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching—the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to define a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with specific methods for generating efficient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers."

Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we cast the problem of point cloud matching as a shape matching problem by transforming each of the given point clouds into a shape representation called the Schrödinger distance transform (SDT) representation. This is achieved by solving a static Schrödinger equation instead of the corresponding static Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this setting. The SDT representation is an analytic expression and following the theoretical physics literature, can be normalized to have unit L2 norm-making it a square-root density, which is identified with a point on a unit Hilbert sphere, whose intrinsic geometry is fully known. The Fisher-Rao metric, a natural metric for the space of densities leads to analytic expressions for the geodesic distance between points on this sphere. In this paper, we use the well known Riemannian framework never before used for point cloud matching, and present a novel matching algorithm. We pose point set matching under rigid and non-rigid transformations in this framework and solve for the transformations using standard nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our algorithm-dubbed SDTM-we present several synthetic and real data examples along with extensive comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point set registration algorithms on many quantitative metrics."

Text: "
A proposal to deal with  French tenses  in the framework of  Discourse Representation Theory  is presented, as it has been implemented for a fragment at the  IMS . It is based on the  theory of tenses  of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer. Instead of using  operators  to express the  meaning  of the  tenses  the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the  tenses  with respect to the  meaning  of the  text  is understood as contribution to the integration of the  events  of a  sentence  in the  event structure  of the preceeding  text . Thereby a  system of relevant times  provided by the preceeding  text  and by the  temporal adverbials  of the  sentence  being processed is used. This system consists of one or more  reference times  and  temporal perspective times , the  speech time  and the  location time . The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of anchors for the  new event  out of the  system of relevant times  and to update this  system of temporal coordinates  correctly. The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature. In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact  meaning  of the  tenses  is fixed by the  resolution component  and not in the process of  syntactic analysis . "

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We propose a novel technique called bispectral photo-metric stereo that makes effective use of fluorescence for shape reconstruction. Fluorescence is a common phenomenon occurring in many objects from natural gems and corals, to fluorescent dyes used in clothing. One of the important characteristics of fluorescence is its wavelength-shifting behavior: fluorescent materials absorb light at a certain wavelength and then reemit it at longer wavelengths. Due to the complexity of its emission process, fluo-rescence tends to be excluded from most algorithms in computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we show that there is a strong similarity between fluorescence and ideal diffuse reflection and that fluorescence can provide distinct clues on how to estimate an object's shape. Moreover , fluorescence's wavelength-shifting property enables us to estimate the shape of an object by applying photomet-ric stereo to emission-only images without suffering from specular reflection. This is the significant advantage of the fluorescence-based method over previous methods based on reflection."

In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In a motorized vehicle a number of easily measurable signals with frequency components related to the rotational speed of the engine can be found, e.g., vibrations, electrical system voltage level, and ambient sound. These signals could potentially be used to estimate the speed and related states of the vehicle. Unfortunately, such estimates would typically require the relations (scale factors) between the frequency components and the speed for different gears to be known. Consequently, in this article we look at the problem of estimating these gear scale factors from training data consisting only of speed measurements and measurements of the signal in question. The estimation problem is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and heuristics is used to find initial values for a numerical evaluation of the estimator. Finally, a measurement campaign is conducted and the functionality of the estimation method is verified on real data."

We describe a set of experiments to explore  statistical techniques  for ranking and selecting the best  translations  in a  graph  of  translation hypotheses . In a previous paper (Carl, 2007) we have described how the  hypotheses graph  is generated through  shallow mapping  and  permutation rules . We have given examples of its  nodes  consisting of  vectors representing morpho-syntactic properties  of  words  and  phrases . This paper describes a number of methods for elaborating  statistical feature functions  from some of the  vector components . The  feature functions  are trained off-line on different types of  text  and their  log-linear combination  is then used to retrieve the best M  translation paths  in the  graph . We compare two  language modelling toolkits , the  CMU  and the  SRI toolkit  and arrive at three results: 1)  word-lemma based feature function models  produce better results than  token-based models , 2) adding a  PoS-tag feature function  to the  word-lemma model  improves the output and 3)  weights  for  lexical translations  are suitable if the  training material  is similar to the  texts  to be translated."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing  probabilistic parser  . The base  parser  produces a set of  candidate parses  for each input  sentence  , with associated  probabilities  that define an initial  ranking  of these  parses  . A second  model  then attempts to improve upon this initial  ranking  , using additional  features  of the  tree  as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a  tree  to be represented as an arbitrary set of  features  , without concerns about how these  features  interact or overlap and without the need to define a  derivation  or a  generative model  which takes these  features  into account . We introduce a new method for the  reranking task  , based on the  boosting approach  to  ranking problems  described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the  boosting method  to  parsing  the  Wall Street Journal treebank  . The method combined the  log-likelihood  under a  baseline model  (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000  features  over  parse trees  that were not included in the original  model  . The new  model  achieved 89.75%  F-measure  , a 13% relative decrease in  F-measure  error over the  baseline model's score  of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the  boosting approach  which takes advantage of the  sparsity of the feature space  in the  parsing data  . Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious  implementation  of the  boosting approach  . We argue that the method is an appealing alternative - in terms of both simplicity and efficiency - to work on  feature selection methods  within  log-linear (maximum-entropy) models  . Although the experiments in this article are on  natural language parsing (NLP)  , the approach should be applicable to many other  NLP problems  which are naturally framed as  ranking tasks  , for example,  speech recognition  ,  machine translation  , or  natural language generation  .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "We present a method for estimating the relative pose of two calibrated or uncalibrated non-overlapping surveillance cameras from observing a moving object. We show how to tackle the problem of missing point correspondences heavily required by SfM pipelines and how to go beyond this basic paradigm. We relax the non-linear nature of the problem by accepting two assumptions which surveillance scenarios offer, ie. the presence of a moving object and easily estimable gravity vector. By those assumptions we cast the problem as a Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem offering an elegant way of treating nonlinear monomials and delivering a quasi closed-form solution as a reliable starting point for a further bundle adjustment. We are the first to bring the closed form solution to such a very practical problem arising in video surveillance. Results in different camera setups demonstrate the feasibility of the approach."

Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations.

We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm.

Text: "We propose a unified variational formulation for joint motion estimation and segmentation with explicit occlusion handling. This is done by a multi-label representation of the flow field, where each label corresponds to a parametric representation of the motion. We use a convex formulation of the multi-label Potts model with label costs and show that the asymmetric map-uniqueness criterion can be integrated into our formulation by means of convex constraints. Explicit occlusion handling eliminates errors otherwise created by the regularization. As occlusions can occur only at object boundaries, a large number of objects may be required. By using a fast primal-dual algorithm we are able to handle several hundred motion segments. Results are shown on several classical motion segmentation and optical flow examples."

Text: "A recognition scheme that scales efficiently to a large number of objects is presented. The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD's. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

We take a selection of both  bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive string comparison methods  , and run each over both  character- and word-segmented data  , in combination with a range of  local segment contiguity models  (in the form of  N-grams  ). Over two distinct  datasets  , we find that  indexing  according to simple  character bigrams  produces a  retrieval accuracy  superior to any of the tested  word N-gram models  . Further,in their optimum  configuration  ,  bag-of-words methods  are shown to be equivalent to  segment order-sensitive methods  in terms of  retrieval accuracy  , but much faster. We also provide evidence that our findings are scalable. "

The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "This paper presents an algorithm for learning the time-varying shape of a non-rigid 3D object from uncalibrated 2D tracking data. We model shape motion as a rigid component (rotation and translation) combined with a non-rigid deformation. Reconstruction is ill-posed if arbitrary deformations are allowed. We constrain the problem by assuming that the object shape at each time instant is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, the algorithm simultaneously estimates 3D shape and motion for each time frame, learns the parameters of the Gaussian, and robustly fills-in missing data points. We then extend the algorithm to model temporal smoothness in object shape, thus allowing it to handle severe cases of missing data."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting.

 This paper describes a system (  RAREAS  ) which synthesizes marine weather forecasts directly from  formatted weather data  .

 A deterministic parser  is under development which represents a departure from  traditional deterministic parsers  in that it combines both  symbolic and connectionist components . The connectionist component is trained either from  patterns  derived from the  rules  of a  deterministic grammar . The development and evolution of such a  hybrid architecture  has lead to a  parser  which is superior to any  known deterministic parser . Experiments are described and powerful  training techniques  are demonstrated that permit  decision-making  by the  connectionist component  in the  parsing process . This approach has permitted some simplifications to the  rules  of other  deterministic parsers , including the elimination of  rule packets  and priorities. Furthermore,  parsing  is performed more robustly and with more tolerance for error. Data are presented which show how a  connectionist (neural) network  trained with  linguistic rules  can parse both  expected (grammatical) sentences  as well as some novel (ungrammatical or lexically ambiguous) sentences.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In the model-based policy search approach to reinforcement learning (RL), policies are found using a model (or "simulator") of the Markov decision process. However, for high-dimensional continuous-state tasks, it can be extremely difficult to build an accurate model, and thus often the algorithm returns a policy that works in simulation but not in real-life. The other extreme, model-free RL, tends to require infeasibly large numbers of real-life trials. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm that requires only an approximate model, and only a small number of real-life trials. The key idea is to successively "ground" the policy evaluations using real-life trials, but to rely on the approximate model to suggest local changes. Our theoretical results show that this algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in the real system, even when the model is only approximate. Empirical results also demonstrate that---when given only a crude model and a small number of real-life trials---our algorithm can obtain near-optimal performance in the real system."

Text: "This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian Particle Dynamics is used for the segmentation of high density crowd flows and detection of flow instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a Flow Map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green Deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

Text: "Automatic image annotation is a newly developed and promising technique to provide semantic image retrieval via text descriptions. It concerns a process of automatically labeling the image contents with a pre-defined set of keywords which are exploited to represent the image semantics. A Maximum Entropy Model-based approach to the task of automatic image annotation is proposed in this paper. In the phase of training, a basic visual vocabulary consisting of blob-tokens to describe the image content is generated at first; then the statistical relationship is modeled between the blob-tokens and keywords by a Maximum Entropy Model constructed from the training set of labeled images. In the phase of annotation, for an unlabeled image, the most likely associated keywords are predicted in terms of the blob-token set extracted from the given image. We carried out experiments on a medium-sized image collection with about 5000 images from Corel Photo CDs. The experimental results demonstrated that the annotation performance of this method outperforms some traditional annotation methods by about 8% in mean precision, showing a potential of the Maximum Entropy Model in the task of automatic image annotation."

Text: "Helping end users build and check process models is a challenge for many science and engineering fields. Many AI researchers have investigated useful ways of verifying and validating knowledge bases for ontologies and rules, but it is not easy to directly apply them to checking process models. Other techniques developed for checking and refining planning knowledge tend to focus on automated plan generation rather than helping users author process information. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach which helps users author and check process models. Our system, called KANAL, relates pieces of information in process models among themselves and to the existing KB, analyzing how different pieces of input are put together to achieve some effect. It builds interdepen-dency models from this analysis and uses them to find errors and propose fixes. Our initial evaluation shows that KANAL was able to find most of the errors in the process models and suggest useful fixes including the fixes that directly point to the sources of the errors."

Text: "We propose an exact, general and efficient coarse-to-fine energy minimization strategy for semantic video segmenta-tion. Our strategy is based on a hierarchical abstraction of the supervoxel graph that allows us to minimize an energy defined at the finest level of the hierarchy by minimizing a series of simpler energies defined over coarser graphs. The strategy is exact, i.e., it produces the same solution as minimizing over the finest graph. It is general, i.e., it can be used to minimize any energy function (e.g., unary, pairwise, and higher-order terms) with any existing energy minimization algorithm (e.g., graph cuts and belief propagation). It also gives significant speedups in inference for several datasets with varying degrees of spatio-temporal continuity. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our strategy relative to existing hierarchical approaches, and the kinds of image and video data that provide the best speedups."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

In this paper, we reported experiments of  unsupervised automatic acquisition  of  Italian and English verb subcategorization frames (SCFs)  from  general and domain corpora .

Although preliminary, reported results are in line with  state-of-the-art lexical acquisition systems . The issue of whether  verbs  sharing similar  SCFs distributions  happen to share  similar semantic properties  as well was also explored by clustering  verbs  that share  frames  with the same  distribution  using the  Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL) . First experiments in this direction were carried out on  Italian verbs  with encouraging results.

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-the-art  Chinese word sense disambiguation model  to choose  translation candidates  for a typical  IBM statistical MT system  , we find that  word sense disambiguation  does not yield significantly better  translation quality  than the  statistical machine translation system  alone.  Error analysis  suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current  statistical MT architectures  . "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

A central problem of  word sense disambiguation (WSD)  is the lack of  manually sense-tagged data  required for  supervised learning  .

Our investigation reveals that this  method of acquiring sense-tagged data  is promising. On a subset of the most difficult  SENSEVAL-2 nouns  , the  accuracy  difference between the two approaches is only 14.0%, and the difference could narrow further to 6.5% if we disregard the advantage that  manually sense-tagged data  have in their  sense coverage  .

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution.

Text: "
This paper proposes a  Hidden Markov Model (HMM)  and an  HMM-based chunk tagger , from which a  named entity (NE) recognition (NER) system  is built to recognize and classify  names ,  times and numerical quantities . Through the  HMM , our system is able to apply and integrate four types of internal and external evidences : 1) simple deterministic internal feature of the  words , such as  capitalization  and digitalization ; 2)  internal semantic feature  of important triggers ; 3)  internal gazetteer feature ; 4)  external macro context feature . In this way, the  NER problem  can be resolved effectively. Evaluation of our  system  on  MUC-6 and MUC-7 English NE tasks  achieves  F-measures  of 96.6% and 94.1% respectively. It shows that the performance is significantly better than reported by any other  machine-learning system . Moreover, the  performance  is even consistently better than those based on  handcrafted rules .

Text: "
This paper presents an analysis of  temporal anaphora  in  sentences  which contain  quantification over events , within the framework of  Discourse Representation Theory . The analysis in (Partee, 1984) of  quantified sentences , introduced by a  temporal connective , gives the wrong  truth-conditions  when the  temporal connective  in the  subordinate clause  is before or after. This  problem  has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the  proportion problem  and given a solution from a  Generalized Quantifier approach . By using a careful distinction between the different notions of  reference time  based on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this  problem , within the framework of  DRT . We show some applications of this  solution  to additional  temporal anaphora phenomena  in  quantified sentences .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In real-world action recognition problems, low-level features cannot adequately characterize the rich spatial-temporal structures in action videos. In this work, we encode actions based on attributes that describes actions as high-level concepts e.g., jump forward or motion in the air. We base our analysis on two types of action attributes. One type of action attributes is generated by humans. The second type is data-driven attributes, which are learned from data using dictionary learning methods. Attribute-based representation may exhibit high variance due to noisy and redundant attributes. We propose a discriminative and compact attribute-based representation by selecting a subset of discriminative attributes from a large attribute set. Three attribute selection criteria are proposed and formulated as a submodular optimization problem. A greedy optimization algorithm is presented and guaranteed to be at least (1-1/e)-approximation to the optimum. Experimental results on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets demonstrate that the proposed attribute-based representation can significantly boost the performance of action recognition algorithms and outperform most recently proposed recognition approaches."

Now, apply this process to the following new text and identify at least 5 scientific entities:

Text: "Visually-guided arm reaching movements are produced by distributed neural networks within parietal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex. Experimental data indicate that (I) single neurons in these regions are broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are elaborated by populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu-rons can be visualized using a neuronal population vector (NPV). However , the NPV provides only a rough estimate of movement parameters (direction, velocity) and may even fail to reflect the parameters of movement when arm posture is changed. We designed a model of the cortical motor command to investigate the relation between the desired direction of the movement, the actual direction of movement and the direction of the NPV in motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural network which combines broadly-tuned (muscular) proprioceptive and (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for the initial part of the movement of a two-link arm. The network was trained by motor babbling in 5 positions. Simulations showed that (1) the network produced appropriate movement direction over a large part of the workspace; (2) small deviations of the actual trajectory from the desired trajectory existed at the extremities of the workspace; (3) these deviations were accompanied by large deviations of the NPV from both trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image of cortical processing during arm reaching movements."

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 Recent advances in  Automatic Speech Recognition technology  have put the goal of naturally sounding  dialog systems  within reach.

The issue of  system response  to  users  has been extensively studied by the  natural language generation community  , though rarely in the context of  dialog systems  .

Text: " 
 We present an efficient algorithm for  chart-based phrase structure parsing  of  natural language  that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from  unrestricted texts  where many of the  words  are unknown and much of the  text  is irrelevant to the task. The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space  . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart  , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span  . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words  , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words  . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges  , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges  , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced.

Text: "
This paper describes an implemented program that takes a  tagged text corpus  and generates a partial list of the  subcategorization frames  in which each  verb  occurs. The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total  occurrences  of each  verb  in the  training corpus .  False positive rates  are one to three percent. Five  subcategorization frames  are currently detected and we foresee no impediment to detecting many more. Ultimately, we expect to provide a large  subcategorization dictionary  to the  NLP community  and to train  dictionaries  for specific  corpora .

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Two main classes of approaches have been studied to perform monocular nonrigid 3D reconstruction: Template-based methods and Non-rigid Structure from Motion techniques. While the first ones have been applied to reconstruct poorly-textured surfaces, they assume the availability of a 3D shape model prior to reconstruction. By contrast, the second ones do not require such a shape template, but, instead, rely on points being tracked throughout a video sequence, and are thus ill-suited to handle poorly-textured surfaces. In this paper, we introduce a template-free approach to reconstructing a poorly-textured, deformable surface. To this end, we leverage surface isometry and formulate 3D reconstruction as the joint problem of non-rigid image registration and depth estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach yields much more accurate 3D reconstructions than state-of-the-art techniques."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "
In this paper we compare two competing approaches to  part-of-speech tagging ,  statistical and constraint-based disambiguation , using  French  as our  test language . We imposed a time limit on our experiment: the amount of time spent on the design of our  constraint system  was about the same as the time we used to train and test the easy-to-implement  statistical model . We describe the two systems and compare the results. The  accuracy  of the  statistical method  is reasonably good, comparable to  taggers  for  English . But the  constraint-based tagger  seems to be superior even with the limited time we allowed ourselves for  rule development .

   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "The goal of this paper is to discover a set of discriminative patches which can serve as a fully unsupervised mid-level visual representation. The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, " visual phrases " , etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discrim-inative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Graph-cuts optimization is prevalent in vision and graphics problems. It is thus of great practical importance to parallelize the graph-cuts optimization using to-day's ubiquitous multi-core machines. However, the current best serial algorithm by Boykov and Kolmogorov [4] (called the BK algorithm) still has the superior empirical performance. It is non-trivial to parallelize as expensive synchronization overhead easily offsets the advantage of parallelism. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive bottom-up approach to parallelize the BK algorithm. We first uniformly partition the graph into a number of regularly-shaped dis-joint subgraphs and process them in parallel, then we incre-mentally merge the subgraphs in an adaptive way to obtain the global optimum. The new algorithm has three benefits: 1) it is more cache-friendly within smaller subgraphs; 2) it keeps balanced workloads among computing cores; 3) it causes little overhead and is adaptable to the number of available cores. Extensive experiments in common applications such as 2D/3D image segmentations and 3D surface fitting demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Text: "Representing images with layers has many important applications , such as video compression, motion analysis, and 3D scene analysis. This paper presents an approach to reliably extracting layers from images by taking advantages of the fact that homographies induced by planar patches in the scene form a low dimensional linear subspace. Layers in the input images will be mapped in the subspace, where it is proven that they form well-defined clusters and can be reliably identified by a simple mean-shift based clustering algorithm. Global optimality is achieved since all valid regions are simultaneously taken into account, and noise can be effectively reduced by enforcing the subspace constraint. Good layer descriptions are shown to be extracted in the experimental results."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We consider a problem of blind source separation from a set of instantaneous linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. It was discovered recently, that exploiting the sparsity of sources in an appropriate representation according to some signal dictionary, dramatically improves the quality of separation. In this work we use the property of multi scale transforms, such as wavelet or wavelet packets, to decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees of sparsity. We use this intrinsic property for selecting the best (most sparse) subsets of features for further separation. The performance of the algorithm is verified on noise-free and noisy data. Experiments with simulated signals, musical sounds and images demonstrate significant improvement of separation quality over previously reported results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Unlike occluded image regions filled by traditional inpainting, highlight pixels contain some useful information for guiding the inpainting process. Constraints provided by observed pixel colors, highlight color analysis and illumination color uniformity are employed in our method to improve estimation of the underlying diffuse color. The inclusion of these illumination constraints allows for better recovery of shading and textures by inpainting. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the performance of our method."

Now, apply this process to the following new text and identify at least 5 scientific entities:

Text: "This paper develops a new approach for extremely fast detection in domains where the distribution of positive and negative examples is highly skewed (e.g. face detection or database retrieval). In such domains a cascade of simple classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000."

The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we present an approach for learning a visual representation from the raw spatiotemporal signals in videos. Our representation is learned without supervision from semantic labels. We formulate our method as an unsupervised sequential verification task, i.e., we determine whether a sequence of frames from a video is in the correct temporal order. With this simple task and no semantic labels, we learn a powerful visual representation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The representation contains complementary information to that learned from supervised image datasets like ImageNet. Qualitative results show that our method captures information that is temporally varying, such as human pose. When used as pre-training for action recognition , our method gives significant gains over learning without external data on benchmark datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. To demonstrate its sensitivity to human pose, we show results for pose estimation on the FLIC and MPII datasets that are competitive, or better than approaches using significantly more supervision. Our method can be combined with supervised representations to provide an additional boost in accuracy."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Image matching is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision. In the context of feature-based matching, SIFT and its variants have long excelled in a wide array of applications. However, for ultra-wide baselines, as in the case of aerial images captured under large camera rotations, the appearance variation goes beyond the reach of SIFT and RANSAC. In this paper we propose a data-driven, deep learning-based approach that sidesteps local correspondence by framing the problem as a classification task. Furthermore , we demonstrate that local correspondences can still be useful. To do so we incorporate an attention mechanism to produce a set of probable matches, which allows us to further increase performance. We train our models on a dataset of urban aerial imagery consisting of 'same' and 'different' pairs, collected for this purpose, and characterize the problem via a human study with annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that our models outperform the state-of-the-art on ultra-wide baseline matching and approach human accuracy."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

This paper presents an approach to the  unsupervised learning  of  parts of speech  which uses both  morphological and syntactic information .

In many  languages ,  morphology  provides better clues to a word's category than  word order .

2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We describe a general framework for online multiclass learning based on the notion of hypothesis sharing. In our framework sets of classes are associated with hypotheses. Thus, all classes within a given set share the same hypothesis. This framework includes as special cases commonly used constructions for multiclass categorization such as allocating a unique hypothesis for each class and allocating a single common hypothesis for all classes. We generalize the multiclass Perceptron to our framework and derive a unifying mistake bound analysis. Our construction naturally extends to settings where the number of classes is not known in advance but, rather, is revealed along the online learning process. We demonstrate the merits of our approach by comparing it to previous methods on both synthetic and natural datasets."

Text: " This paper presents a  formal analysis  for a large class of  words  called  alternative markers  , which includes  other (than)  ,  such (as)  , and  besides  .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Speech-based depression detection has gained importance in recent years, but most research has used relatively quiet conditions or examined a single corpus per study. Little is thus known about the robustness of speech cues in the wild. This study compares the effect of noise and reverberation on depression prediction using 1) standard mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and 2) features designed for noise robustness, damped oscillator cepstral coefficients (DOCCs). Data come from the 2014 AudioVisual Emotion Recognition Challenge (AVEC). Results using additive noise and reverberation reveal a consistent pattern of findings for multiple evaluation metrics under both matched and mismatched conditions. First and most notably: standard MFCC features suffer dramatically under test/train mismatch for both noise and reverberation; DOCC features are far more robust. Second, including higher-order cepstral coefficients is generally beneficial. Third, artificial neural networks tend to outperform support vector regression. Fourth, spontaneous speech appears to offer better robustness than read speech. Finally, a cross-corpus (and cross-language) experiment reveals better noise and reverberation robustness for DOCCs than for MFCCs. Implications and future directions for real-world robust depression detection are discussed."

Text: "A new exemplar-based framework unifying image completion , texture synthesis and image inpainting is presented in this work. Contrary to existing greedy techniques, these tasks are posed in the form of a discrete global optimization problem with a well defined objective function. For solving this problem a novel optimization scheme, called Priority-BP, is proposed which carries two very important extensions over standard belief propagation (BP): " priority-based message scheduling " and " dynamic label pruning ". These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP caused by the huge number of existing labels. Moreover, both extensions are generic and can therefore be applied to any MRF energy function as well. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a wide variety of image completion examples."

 Automatic summarization  and  information extraction  are two important Internet services.  MUC  and  SUMMAC  play their appropriate roles in the next generation Internet. This paper focuses on the  automatic summarization  and proposes two different models to extract  sentences  for  summary generation  under two tasks initiated by  SUMMAC-1 . For  categorization task ,  positive feature vectors  and  negative feature vectors  are used cooperatively to construct generic, indicative  summaries . For adhoc task, a  text model  based on relationship between  nouns  and  verbs  is used to filter out irrelevant  discourse segment , to rank relevant  sentences , and to generate the  user-directed summaries . The result shows that the  NormF  of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for adhoc tasks are 0.456 and 0. 447. The  NormF  of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for  categorization task  are 0.4090 and 0.4023.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to detect/compensate on-line interference effects when integrating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). The GNSS/INS coupling is usually performed by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which yields an accurate and robust localization. However , interference cause the GNSS measurement noise to increase unexpectedly, hence degrade the positioning accuracy. In this context , our contribution is twofold. We first study the impact of the GNSS noise inflation on the covariance of the EKF outputs so as to compute a least square estimate of the potential variance jumps. Then, this estimation is used in a Bayesian test which decides whether interference are corrupting the GNSS signal or not. It allows us to estimate their times of occurrence as well. In this way, the impaired measurements can be discarded while their impact on the navigation solution can be compensated. The results show the performance of the proposed approach on simulated data."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Despite their success, convolutional neural networks are computationally expensive because they must examine all image locations. Stochastic attention-based models have been shown to improve computational efficiency at test time, but they remain difficult to train because of intractable posterior inference and high variance in the stochastic gradient estimates. Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients. We show that our method can greatly speed up the training time for stochastic attention networks in the domains of image classification and caption generation."

Text: " This paper concerns the  discourse understanding process  in  spoken dialogue systems  . This process enables the system to understand  user utterances  based on the  context  of a  dialogue  . Since multiple  candidates  for the  understanding  result can be obtained for a  user utterance  due to the  ambiguity  of  speech understanding  , it is not appropriate to decide on a single  understanding  result after each  user utterance  . By holding multiple  candidates  for  understanding  results and resolving the  ambiguity  as the  dialogue  progresses, the  discourse understanding accuracy  can be improved. This paper proposes a method for resolving this  ambiguity  based on  statistical information  obtained from  dialogue corpora  . Unlike conventional methods that use  hand-crafted rules  , the proposed method enables easy design of the  discourse understanding process  . Experiment results have shown that a system that exploits the proposed method performs sufficiently and that holding multiple  candidates  for  understanding  results is effective. "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We investigated whether automatic phonetic transcriptions (APTs) can replace manually verified phonetic transcriptions (MPTs) in a large corpus-based study on pronunciation variation. To this end, we compared the performance of both transcription types in a classification experiment aimed at establishing the direct influence of a particular situational setting on pronunciation variation. We trained classifiers on the speech processes extracted from the alignments of an APT and an MPT with a canonical transcription. We tested whether the classifiers were equally good at verifying whether unknown transcriptions represent read speech or telephone dialogues, and whether the same speech processes were identified to distinguish between transcriptions of the two situational settings. Our results not only show that similar distinguishing speech processes were identified; our APT-based classifier yielded better classification accuracy than the MPT-based classifier whilst using fewer classification features."

The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
In this paper, we present a  fully automated extraction system , named  IntEx , to identify  gene and protein interactions  in  biomedical text . Our approach is based on first splitting  complex sentences  into  simple clausal structures  made up of  syntactic roles . Then, tagging  biological entities  with the help of  biomedical and linguistic ontologies . Finally, extracting  complete interactions  by analyzing the matching contents of  syntactic roles  and their linguistically significant combinations. Our  extraction system  handles  complex sentences  and extracts  multiple and nested interactions  specified in a  sentence . Experimental evaluations with two other state of the art  extraction systems  indicate that the  IntEx system  achieves better  performance  without the labor intensive  pattern engineering requirement .

Text: "
This paper shows how  dictionary word sense definitions  can be analysed by applying a hierarchy of  phrasal patterns . An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing  definitions  from the  Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English . A property of this  dictionary , exploited by the system, is that it uses a  restricted vocabulary  in its  word sense definitions . The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the  classification  of new  word senses  in terms of the  senses  of  words  in the  restricted vocabulary . Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific  phrasal analysis rules  as determined by a hierarchy of  patterns  in which less specific  patterns  dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the  definitions  are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust  analysis mechanism . Thus the work reported addresses two  robustness problems  faced by current experimental  natural language processing systems : coping with an incomplete  lexicon  and with incomplete  knowledge  of  phrasal constructions .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper addresses the issue of  word-sense ambiguity  in extraction from  machine-readable resources  for the construction of  large-scale knowledge sources . We describe two experiments: one which ignored  word-sense distinctions , resulting in 6.3% accuracy for  semantic classification  of  verbs  based on (Levin, 1993); and one which exploited  word-sense distinctions , resulting in 97.9% accuracy. These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that  verb semantics  and  syntactic behavior  are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving  semantic information  from  syntactic cues  if we first divide the  syntactic cues  into distinct groupings that correlate with different  word senses . Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel  word senses  using a combination of online sources.

Text: " The theoretical study of the  range concatenation grammar [RCG] formalism  has revealed many attractive properties which may be used in  NLP  . In particular,  range concatenation languages [RCL]  can be parsed in  polynomial time  and many classical  grammatical formalisms  can be translated into equivalent  RCGs  without increasing their  worst-case parsing time complexity  . For example, after  translation  into an equivalent  RCG  , any  tree adjoining grammar  can be parsed in  O(n6) time  . In this paper, we study a  parsing technique  whose purpose is to improve the practical efficiency of  RCL parsers  . The  non-deterministic parsing choices  of the  main parser  for a  language L  are directed by a  guide  which uses the  shared derivation forest  output by a prior  RCL parser  for a suitable  superset of L  . The results of a practical evaluation of this method on a  wide coverage English grammar  are given. "

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

Text: " 
 We describe a  generative probabilistic model of natural language  , which we call  HBG  , that takes advantage of detailed  linguistic information  to resolve  ambiguity  .   HBG  incorporates  lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information  from the  parse tree  into the  disambiguation process  in a novel way. We use a  corpus of bracketed sentences  , called a  Treebank  , in combination with  decision tree building  to tease out the relevant aspects of a  parse tree  that will determine the correct  parse  of a  sentence  . This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further  grammar  tailoring via the usual  linguistic introspection  in the hope of generating the correct  parse  . In  head-to-head tests  against one of the best existing robust  probabilistic parsing models  , which we call  P-CFG , the  HBG model  significantly outperforms  P-CFG  , increasing the  parsing accuracy  rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Category: Task
Reasoning: This describes the main objective of the system, which is a specific scientific task.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we present a digital signal processor (DSP) implementation of real-time statistical voice conversion (VC) for silent speech enhancement and electrolaryngeal speech enhancement. As a silent speech interface, we focus on non-audible murmur (NAM), which can be used in situations where audible speech is not acceptable. Electrolaryngeal speech is one of the typical types of alaryngeal speech produced by an alternative speaking method for laryngectomees. However, the sound quality of NAM and electrolaryngeal speech suffers from lack of naturalness. VC has proven to be one of the promising approaches to address this problem, and it has been successfully implemented on devices with sufficient computational resources. An implementation on devices that are highly portable but have limited computational resources would greatly contribute to its practical use. In this paper we further implement real-time VC on a DSP. To implement the two speech enhancement systems based on real-time VC, one from NAM to a whispered voice and the other from electrolaryngeal speech to a natural voice, we propose several methods for reducing computational cost while preserving conversion accuracy. We conduct experimental evaluations and show that real-time VC is capable of running on a DSP with little degradation."

Text: "
We present a  tool , called  ILIMP , which takes as input a  raw text  in  French  and produces as output the same  text  in which every occurrence of the  pronoun il  is tagged either with tag  [ANA]  for  anaphoric  or  [IMP]  for  impersonal  or  expletive . This  tool  is therefore designed to distinguish between the  anaphoric occurrences of il , for which an  anaphora resolution system  has to look for an antecedent, and the  expletive occurrences  of this  pronoun , for which it does not make sense to look for an antecedent. The  precision rate  for  ILIMP  is 97,5%. The few  errors  are analyzed in detail. Other  tasks  using the  method  developed for  ILIMP  are described briefly, as well as the use of  ILIMP  in a modular  syntactic analysis system . "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "  Oral communication  is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document. Given the development of  storage media and networks  one could just record and store a  conversation  for documentation. The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a  large database  . Traditional  information retrieval techniques  use a  histogram  of  keywords  as the  document representation  but  oral communication  may offer additional  indices  such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance. An alternative  index  could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc. This paper addresses the problem of the  automatic detection  of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders. Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger  database  and detect those automatically which is shown on a large  database  of  TV shows  .  Emotions  and other  indices  such as the  dominance distribution of speakers  might be available on the  surface  and could be used directly. Despite the small size of the  databases  used some results about the effectiveness of these  indices  can be obtained. "

Text: "Boosting methods are known not to usually overfit training data even as the size of the generated classifiers becomes large. Schapire et al. attempted to explain this phenomenon in terms of the margins the classifier achieves on training examples. Later, however, Breiman cast serious doubt on this explanation by introducing a boosting algorithm, arc-gv, that can generate a higher margins distribution than AdaBoost and yet performs worse. In this paper, we take a close look at Breiman's compelling but puzzling results. Although we can reproduce his main finding, we find that the poorer performance of arc-gv can be explained by the increased complexity of the base classifiers it uses, an explanation supported by our experiments and entirely consistent with the margins theory. Thus, we find maximizing the margins is desirable, but not necessarily at the expense of other factors, especially base-classifier complexity."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm.

Text: "Visitors who browse the web from wireless PDAs, cell phones, and pagers are frequently stymied by web interfaces optimized for desktop PCs. Simply replacing graphics with text and reformatting tables does not solve the problem, because deep link structures can still require minutes to traverse. In this paper we develop an algorithm, MINPATH, that automatically improves wireless web navigation by suggesting useful shortcut links in real time. MINPATH finds shortcuts by using a learned model of web visitor behavior to estimate the savings of shortcut links, and suggests only the few best links. We explore a variety of predictive models, including Na¨ıve Bayes mixture models and mixtures of Markov models, and report empirical evidence that MINPATH finds useful shortcuts that save substantial navigational effort."

Text: " 
 It is often assumed that when  natural language processing  meets the real world, the ideal of aiming for complete and correct interpretations has to be abandoned. However, our experience with  TACITUS  ; especially in the  MUC-3 evaluation  , has shown that principled techniques for  syntactic and pragmatic analysis  can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making  syntactic analysis  more robust---an  agenda-based scheduling parser  , a  recovery technique for failed parses  , and a new technique called  terminal substring parsing  . For  pragmatics processing  , we describe how the method of  abductive inference  is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required  world knowledge  , performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented. "

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

STTK  , a  statistical machine translation tool kit  , will be introduced and used to build a working  translation system  .  STTK  has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of  CMU's SMT system  . It has also successfully been coupled with  rule-based and example based machine translation modules  to build a  multi engine machine translation system  .

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

* categorizing unknown words
Category: Task
Reasoning: This describes the main objective of the system, which is a specific scientific task.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " This paper presents an  unsupervised learning approach  to building a  non-English (Arabic) stemmer  . The  stemming model  is based on  statistical machine translation  and it uses an  English stemmer  and a small (10K sentences)  parallel corpus  as its sole  training resources  . No  parallel text  is needed after the  training phase  .  Monolingual, unannotated text  can be used to further improve the  stemmer  by allowing it to adapt to a desired  domain  or  genre  . Examples and results will be given for  Arabic  , but the approach is applicable to any  language  that needs  affix removal  . Our  resource-frugal approach  results in 87.5%  agreement  with a state of the art, proprietary  Arabic stemmer  built using  rules  ,  affix lists  , and  human annotated text  , in addition to an  unsupervised component  .  Task-based evaluation  using  Arabic information retrieval  indicates an improvement of 22-38% in  average precision  over  unstemmed text  , and 96% of the performance of the proprietary  stemmer  above.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting.

Text: "
We describe a new method for the representation of  NLP structures  within  reranking approaches . We make use of a  conditional log-linear model , with  hidden variables  representing the  assignment  of  lexical items  to  word clusters  or  word senses . The model learns to automatically make these  assignments  based on a  discriminative training criterion .  Training  and  decoding  with the model requires summing over an exponential number of  hidden-variable assignments : the required summations can be computed efficiently and exactly using  dynamic programming . As a case study, we apply the model to  parse reranking . The model gives an  F-measure improvement  of ~1.25% beyond the  base parser , and an ~0.25% improvement beyond  Collins (2000) reranker . Although our experiments are focused on  parsing , the techniques described generalize naturally to  NLP structures  other than  parse trees .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "Within the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL, a challenge was organized to design a statistical machine learning algorithm that segments words into the smallest meaning-bearing units of language , morphemes. Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as speech and text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval, and statistical language modeling. Twelve research groups participated in the challenge and had submitted segmentation results obtained by their algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the application of these segmen-tation algorithms to large vocabulary speech recognition using statistical n-gram language models based on the proposed word segments instead of entire words. Experiments were done for two ag-glutinative and morphologically rich languages: Finnish and Turk-ish. We also investigate combining various segmentations to improve the performance of the recognizer."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "This paper presents an algorithm for labeling curvilinear structure at multiple scales in line drawings and edge images Symbolic CURVE-ELEMENT tokens residing in a spatially-indexed and scale-indexed data structure denote circular arcs fit to image data. Tokens are computed via a small-to-large scale grouping procedure employing a " greedy " , best-first, strategy for choosing the support of new tokens. The resulting image description is rich and redundant in that a given segment of image contour may be described by multiple tokens at different scales, and by more than one token at any given scale. This property facilitates selection and characterization of portions of the image based on local CURVE-ELEMENT attributes.

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

In our current research into the design of  cognitively well-motivated interfaces  relying primarily on the  display of graphical information , we have observed that  graphical information  alone does not provide sufficient support to users - particularly when situations arise that do not simply conform to the users' expectations. This can occur due to too much  information  being requested, too little,  information  of the wrong kind, etc. To solve this problem, we are working towards the integration of  natural language generation  to augment the  interaction "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "Image sequence processing techniques are used to study exchange , growth, and transport processes and to tackle key questions in environmental physics and biology. These applications require high accuracy for the estimation of the motion field since the most interesting parameters of the dynamical processes studied are contained in first-order derivatives of the motion field or in dynamical changes of the moving objects. Therefore the performance and optimization of low-level motion estimators is discussed. A tensor method tuned with carefully optimized derivative filters yields reliable and dense displacement vector fields (DVF) with an accuracy of up to a few hundredth pixels/frame for real-world images. The accuracy of the tensor method is verified with computer-generated sequences and a calibrated image sequence. With the improvements in accuracy the motion estimation is now rather limited by imperfections in the CCD sensors, especially the spatial nonuni-formity in the responsivity. With a simple two-point calibration, these effects can efficiently be suppressed. The application of the techniques to the analysis of plant growth, to ocean surface microturbulence in IR image sequences, and to sediment transport is demonstrated."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
The paper proposes and empirically motivates an integration of  supervised learning  with  unsupervised learning  to deal with human biases in  summarization . In particular, we explore the use of  probabilistic decision tree  within the clustering framework to account for the variation as well as regularity in  human created summaries . The  corpus  of human created extracts is created from a  newspaper corpus  and used as a test set. We build  probabilistic decision trees  of different flavors and integrate each of them with the clustering framework. Experiments with the  corpus  demonstrate that the mixture of the two paradigms generally gives a significant boost in performance compared to cases where either ofthe two is considered alone.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper proposes an automatic, essentially  domain-independent means of evaluating Spoken Language Systems (SLS)  which combines  software  we have developed for that purpose (the " Comparator ") and a set of  specifications  for  answer expressions  (the " Common Answer Specification ", or  CAS ). The  Comparator  checks whether the answer provided by a  SLS  accords with a  canonical answer , returning either true or false. The  Common Answer Specification  determines the  syntax  of  answer expressions , the minimal  content  that must be included in them, the  data  to be included in and excluded from  test corpora , and the  procedures  used by the  Comparator . Though some details of the  CAS  are particular to individual  domains , the  Comparator software  is  domain-independent , as is the  CAS approach .

This paper defines a  generative probabilistic model  of  parse trees , which we call  PCFG-LA . This  model  is an extension of  PCFG  in which  non-terminal symbols  are augmented with  latent variables . Finegrained  CFG rules  are automatically induced from a  parsed corpus  by  training  a  PCFG-LA model  using an  EM-algorithm . Because exact  parsing  with a  PCFG-LA  is  NP-hard , several  approximations  are described and empirically compared.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm.

Text: "
A method of  sense resolution  is proposed that is based on  WordNet , an on-line  lexical database  that incorporates  semantic relations  ( synonymy ,  antonymy ,  hyponymy ,  meronymy ,  causal and troponymic entailment ) as  labeled pointers  between  word senses . With  WordNet , it is easy to retrieve sets of  semantically related words , a facility that will be used for  sense resolution  during  text processing , as follows. When a  word  with multiple  senses  is encountered, one of two procedures will be followed. Either, (1)  words  related in  meaning  to the  alternative senses  of the  polysemous word  will be retrieved; new  strings  will be derived by substituting these related  words  into the  context  of the  polysemous word ; a large  textual corpus  will then be searched for these  derived strings ; and that  sense  will be chosen that corresponds to the  derived string  that is found most often in the  corpus . Or, (2) the  context  of the  polysemous word  will be used as a key to search a large  corpus ; all  words  found to occur in that  context  will be noted;  WordNet  will then be used to estimate the  semantic distance  from those  words  to the  alternative senses  of the  polysemous word ; and that  sense  will be chosen that is closest in  meaning  to other  words  occurring in the same  context  If successful, this procedure could have practical applications to problems of  information retrieval ,  mechanical translation ,  intelligent tutoring systems , and elsewhere.

Text: "
Theoretical research in the area of  machine translation  usually involves the search for and creation of an appropriate  formalism . An important issue in this respect is the way in which the  compositionality  of  translation  is to be defined. In this paper, we will introduce the  anaphoric component  of the  Mimo formalism . It makes the definition and  translation  of  anaphoric relations  possible,  relations  which are usually problematic for systems that adhere to  strict compositionality . In  Mimo , the  translation  of  anaphoric relations  is compositional. The  anaphoric component  is used to define  linguistic phenomena  such as  wh-movement , the  passive  and the  binding of reflexives and pronouns  mono-lingually. The actual working of the component will be shown in this paper by means of a detailed discussion of  wh-movement .

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 Pipelined Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems  have grown increasingly complex as  architectural modules  were added to support  language functionalities  such as  referring expressions ,  lexical choice , and  revision . This has given rise to discussions about the relative placement of these new  modules  in the overall  architecture . Recent work on another aspect of  multi-paragraph text ,  discourse markers , indicates it is time to consider where a  discourse marker insertion algorithm  fits in.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

Text: "
 We give an analysis of  ellipsis resolution  in terms of a straightforward  discourse copying algorithm  that correctly predicts a wide range of phenomena. The treatment does not suffer from problems inherent in  identity-of-relations analyses . Furthermore, in contrast to the approach of Dalrymple et al. [1991], the treatment directly encodes the intuitive distinction between  full NPs  and the  referential elements  that corefer with them through what we term  role linking . The correct  predictions  for several problematic examples of  ellipsis  naturally result. Finally, the analysis extends directly to other  discourse copying phenomena . "

A  model  is presented to characterize the  class of languages  obtained by adding  reduplication  to  context-free languages .

Text: "
This article deals with the  interpretation  of  conceptual operations  underlying the communicative use of  natural language (NL)  within the  Structured Inheritance Network (SI-Nets) paradigm . The operations are reduced to  functions  of a  formal language , thus changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on  SI-Nets . In this sense, operations on  SI-Nets  are not merely isomorphic to single epistemological objects, but can be viewed as a simulation of processes on a different level, that pertaining to the  conceptual system  of  NL . For this purpose, we have designed a version of  KL-ONE  which represents the  epistemological level , while the new experimental language,  KL-Conc , represents the  conceptual level . KL-Conc would seem to be a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with  SI-Nets . "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

The  interlingual approach to MT  has been repeatedly advocated by researchers originally interested in  natural language understanding  who take  machine translation  to be one possible application. However, not only the  ambiguity  but also the vagueness which every  natural language  inevitably has leads this approach into essential difficulties. In contrast, our project, the  Mu-project , adopts the  transfer approach  as the basic framework of  MT . This paper describes the detailed construction of the  transfer phase  of our system from  Japanese  to  English , and gives some examples of problems which seem difficult to treat in the  interlingual approach . The basic design principles of the  transfer phase  of our system have already been mentioned in (1) (2). Some of the principles which are relevant to the topic of this paper are: (a)  Multiple Layer of Grammars  (b)  Multiple Layer Presentation  (c)  Lexicon Driven Processing  (d)  Form-Oriented Dictionary Description . This paper also shows how these principles are realized in the current system.

In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper we present a novel autonomous pipeline to build a personalized parametric model (pose-driven avatar) using a single depth sensor. Our method first captures a few high-quality scans of the user rotating herself at multiple poses from different views. We fit each incomplete scan using template fitting techniques with a generic human template, and register all scans to every pose using global consistency constraints. After registration, these watertight models with different poses are used to train a parametric model in a fashion similar to the SCAPE method. Once the parametric model is built, it can be used as an anim-itable avatar or more interestingly synthesizing dynamic 3D models from single-view depth videos. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system to produce dynamic models."

Text: "
Robust  natural language interpretation  requires strong  semantic domain models ,  fail-soft recovery heuristics , and very flexible  control structures . Although  single-strategy parsers  have met with a measure of success, a  multi-strategy approach  is shown to provide a much higher degree of flexibility, redundancy, and ability to bring  task-specific domain knowledge  (in addition to  general linguistic knowledge ) to bear on both  grammatical and ungrammatical input . A  parsing algorithm  is presented that integrates several different  parsing strategies , with  case-frame instantiation  dominating. Each of these  parsing strategies  exploits different  types of knowledge ; and their combination provides a strong framework in which to process  conjunctions ,  fragmentary input , and  ungrammatical structures , as well as less exotic,  grammatically correct input . Several  specific heuristics  for handling  ungrammatical input  are presented within this  multi-strategy framework . "

Text: " 
 This paper introduces a robust  interactive method for speech understanding  . The  generalized LR parsing  is enhanced in this approach.  Parsing  proceeds from left to right correcting minor errors. When a very noisy  portion  is detected, the  parser  skips that  portion  using a fake  non-terminal symbol  . The unidentified  portion  is resolved by  re-utterance  of that  portion  which is parsed very efficiently by using the  parse record  of the first  utterance  . The  user  does not have to speak the whole  sentence  again. This method is also capable of handling  unknown words  , which is important in practical systems. Detected  unknown words  can be incrementally incorporated into the  dictionary  after the interaction with the  user  . A  pilot system  has shown great effectiveness of this approach. "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
Empirical experience and observations have shown us when powerful and highly tunable  classifiers  such as  maximum entropy classifiers ,  boosting  and  SVMs  are applied to  language processing tasks , it is possible to achieve high accuracies, but eventually their performances all tend to plateau out at around the same point. To further improve performance, various  error correction mechanisms  have been developed, but in practice, most of them cannot be relied on to predictably improve performance on  unseen data ; indeed, depending upon the  test set , they are as likely to degrade accuracy as to improve it. This problem is especially severe if the  base classifier  has already been finely tuned. In recent work, we introduced  N-fold Templated Piped Correction, or NTPC ("nitpick") , an intriguing  error corrector  that is designed to work in these extreme operating conditions. Despite its simplicity, it consistently and robustly improves the accuracy of existing highly accurate  base models . This paper investigates some of the more surprising claims made by  NTPC , and presents experiments supporting an  Occam's Razor argument  that more complex models are damaging or unnecessary in practice.

Text: "Recent advances in linear classification have shown that for applications such as document classification, the training can be extremely efficient. However, most of the existing training methods are designed by assuming that data can be stored in the computer memory. These methods cannot be easily applied to data larger than the memory capacity due to the random access to the disk. We propose and analyze a block minimization framework for data larger than the memory size. At each step a block of data is loaded from the disk and handled by certain learning methods. We investigate two implementations of the proposed framework for primal and dual SVMs, respectively. As data cannot fit in memory, many design considerations are very different from those for traditional algorithms. Experiments using data sets 20 times larger than the memory demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Scientific Entities Identified:

* categorizing unknown words
Category: Task
Reasoning: This describes the main objective of the system, which is a specific scientific task.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We propose an efficient dialogue management for an information navigation system based on a document knowledge base. It is expected that incorporation of appropriate N-best candidates of ASR and contextual information will improve the system performance. The system also has several choices in generating responses or confirmations. In this paper, this selection is optimized as minimization of Bayes risk based on reward for correct information presentation and penalty for redundant turns. We have evaluated this strategy with our spoken dialogue system " Dialogue Navigator for Kyoto City " , which also has question-answering capability. Effectiveness of the proposed framework was confirmed in the success rate of retrieval and the average number of turns for information access."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
 This paper discusses the application of  Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG)  to the framework of  Isomorphic Grammars  for  Machine Translation  pioneered by Landsbergen. The  Isomorphic Grammars approach to MT  involves developing the  grammars  of the  Source and Target languages  in parallel, in order to ensure that  SL  and  TL  expressions which stand in the  translation relation  have  isomorphic derivations  . The principle advantage of this approach is that knowledge concerning translation equivalence of expressions may be directly exploited, obviating the need for answers to  semantic questions  that we do not yet have.  Semantic  and other information may still be incorporated, but as constraints on the  translation relation  , not as levels of  textual representation  . After introducing this approach to  MT system  design, and the basics of  monolingual UCG  , we will show how the two can be integrated, and present an example from an implemented  bi-directional English-Spanish fragment  . Finally we will present some outstanding problems with the approach. "

Text: "It is well-known that diversity among base classifiers is crucial for constructing a strong ensemble. Most existing ensemble methods obtain diverse individual learners through resampling the instances or features. In this paper, we propose an alternative way for ensemble construction by resampling pairwise constraints that specify whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class or not. Using pairwise constraints for ensemble construction is challenging because it remains unknown how to influence the base classifiers with the sampled pairwise constraints. We solve this problem with a two-step process. First, we transform the original instances into a new data representation using projections learnt from pairwise constraints. Then, we build the base clas-sifiers with the new data representation. We propose two methods for resampling pairwise constraints following the standard Bagging and Boosting algorithms, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

Text: " In this paper a novel solution to automatic and  unsupervised word sense induction (WSI)  is introduced. It represents an instantiation of the  one sense per collocation observation  (Gale et al., 1992). Like most existing approaches it utilizes  clustering of word co-occurrences  . This approach differs from other approaches to  WSI  in that it enhances the effect of the  one sense per collocation observation  by using triplets of  words  instead of pairs. The combination with a  two-step clustering process  using  sentence co-occurrences  as  features  allows for accurate results. Additionally, a novel and likewise automatic and  unsupervised evaluation method  inspired by Schutze's (1992) idea of evaluation of  word sense disambiguation algorithms  is employed. Offering advantages like reproducability and independency of a given biased  gold standard  it also enables  automatic parameter optimization  of the  WSI algorithm  . "

Text: "With the recent popularity of animated GIFs on social media, there is need for ways to index them with rich meta-data. To advance research on animated GIF understanding, we collected a new dataset, Tumblr GIF (TGIF), with 100K animated GIFs from Tumblr and 120K natural language descriptions obtained via crowdsourcing. The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form text input from crowd-workers. We show that there is unambiguous association between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and video description datasets. Next, we provide baseline results on the animated GIF description task, using three representative techniques: nearest neighbor, statistical machine translation , and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we show that models fine-tuned from our animated GIF description dataset can be helpful for automatic movie description."

The  PRC Adaptive Knowledge-based Text Understanding System (PAKTUS)  has been under development as an Independent Research and Development project at PRC since 1984. The objective is a generic system of tools, including a  core English lexicon ,  grammar , and concept representations, for building  natural language processing (NLP) systems  for  text understanding . Systems built with  PAKTUS  are intended to generate input to knowledge based systems ordata base systems. Input to the  NLP system  is typically derived from an existing  electronic message stream , such as a news wire.  PAKTUS  supports the adaptation of the generic core to a variety of domains:  JINTACCS messages ,  RAINFORM messages ,  news reports  about a specific type of event, such as financial transfers or terrorist acts, etc., by acquiring  sublanguage and domain-specific grammar ,  words, conceptual mappings , and  discourse patterns . The long-term goal is a system that can support the processing of relatively long discourses in domains that are fairly broad with a high rate of success.

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, a novel method to learn the intrinsic object structure for robust visual tracking is proposed. The basic assumption is that the parameterized object state lies on a low dimensional manifold and can be learned from training data. Based on this assumption, firstly we derived the dimensionality reduction and density estimation algorithm for unsupervised learning of object intrinsic representation, the obtained non-rigid part of object state reduces even to 2 dimensions. Secondly the dynamical model is derived and trained based on this intrinsic representation. Thirdly the learned intrinsic object structure is integrated into a particle-filter style tracker. We will show that this intrinsic object representation has some interesting properties and based on which the newly derived dynamical model makes particle-filter style tracker more robust and reliable. Experiments show that the learned tracker performs much better than existing trackers on the tracking of complex non-rigid motions such as fish twisting with self-occlusion and large inter-frame lip motion. The proposed method also has the potential to solve other type of tracking problems."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In cross-domain learning, there is a more challenging problem that the domain divergence involves more than one dominant factors, e.g., different viewpoints , various resolutions and changing illuminations. Fortunately, an intermediate domain could often be found to build a bridge across them to facilitate the learning problem. In this paper, we propose a Coupled Marginalized Denoising Auto-encoders framework to address the cross-domain problem. Specifically, we design two marginalized denoising auto-encoders, one for the target and the other for source as well as the intermediate one. To better couple the two denoising auto-encoders learning, we incorporate a feature mapping, which tends to transfer knowledge between the intermediate domain and the target one. Furthermore, the maximum margin criterion, e.g., intra-class com-pactness and inter-class penalty, on the output layer is imposed to seek more discriminative features across different domains. Extensive experiments on two tasks have demonstrated the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: " 
  Chart parsing  is  directional  in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner. We shall introduce the concept of a  chart  that works outward from  islands  and makes sense of as much of the  sentence  as it is actually possible, and after that will lead to predictions of missing  fragments  . So, for any place where the easily identifiable  fragments  occur in the  sentence  , the process will extend to both the left and the right of the  islands  , until possibly completely missing  fragments  are reached. At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found,  heuristics  can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing  fragments  . "

Text: "For mobile speech application, speaker DOA estimation accuracy, interference robustness and compact physical size are three key factors. Considering the size, we utilized acoustic vector sensor (AVS) and proposed a DOA estimation algorithm previously [1], offering high accuracy with larger-than-15dB SNR but is deteriorated by non-speech interferences (NSI). This paper develops a robust speaker DOA estimation algorithm. It is achieved by deriving the inter-sensor data ratio model of an AVS in bispectrum domain (BISDR) and exploring the favorable properties of bispectrum, such as zero value of Gaussian process and different distribution of speech and NSI. Specifically, a reliable bispectrum mask is generated to guarantee that the speaker DOA cues, derived from BISDR, are robust to NSI in terms of speech sparsity and large bispectrum amplitude of the captured signals. Intensive experiments demonstrate an improved performance of our proposed algorithm under various NSI conditions even when SIR is smaller than 0dB."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

 Sentiment Classification  seeks to identify a piece of  text  according to its author's general feeling toward their  subject , be it positive or negative.

Text: "We attempt to understand visual classification in humans using both psy-chophysical and machine learning techniques. Frontal views of human faces were used for a gender classification task. Human subjects classified the faces and their gender judgment, reaction time and confidence rating were recorded. Several hyperplane learning algorithms were used on the same classification task using the Principal Components of the texture and flowfield representation of the faces. The classification performance of the learning algorithms was estimated using the face database with the true gender of the faces as labels, and also with the gender estimated by the subjects. We then correlated the human responses to the distance of the stimuli to the separating hyperplane of the learning algorithms. Our results suggest that human classification can be modeled by some hyperplane algorithms in the feature space we used. For classification , the brain needs more processing for stimuli close to that hyperplane than for those further away."

Text: "
The study addresses the problem of  automatic acquisition  of  entailment relations  between  verbs . While this task has much in common with  paraphrases acquisition  which aims to discover  semantic equivalence  between  verbs , the main challenge of  entailment acquisition  is to capture  asymmetric, or directional, relations . Motivated by the intuition that it often underlies the  local structure  of  coherent text , we develop a method that discovers  verb entailment  using evidence about  discourse relations  between  clauses  available in a  parsed corpus . In comparison with earlier work, the proposed method covers a much wider range of  verb entailment types  and learns the  mapping  between  verbs  with highly varied  argument structures .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

"To explain complex phenomena, an  explanation system  must be able to select information from a formal representation of  domain knowledge , organize the selected information into  multisentential discourse plans , and realize the  discourse plans  in text. Although recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of sophisticated computational mechanisms for  explanation , empirical results have been limited. This paper reports on a seven-year effort to empirically study  explanation generation  from  semantically rich, large-scale knowledge bases . In particular, it describes a  robust explanation system  that constructs  multisentential and multi-paragraph explanations  from the a  large-scale knowledge base  in the domain of botanical anatomy, physiology, and development. We introduce the evaluation methodology and describe how performance was assessed with this methodology in the most extensive empirical evaluation conducted on an explanation system. In this evaluation, scored within ""half a grade"" of domain experts, and its performance exceeded that of one of the domain experts."

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Constraint propagation is one of the key techniques in constraint programming, and a large body of work has built up around it. Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports — by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support (a justification that a variable-value pair still forms part of a solution to the constraint) for all other variables and values and save substantial work. Recently short supports have been used in general purpose prop-agators, and (when the constraint is amenable to short supports) speed ups of more than three orders of magnitude have been demonstrated. In this paper we present SHORTSTR2, a development of the Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2+. We show that SHORTSTR2 is complementary to the existing algorithms SHORTGAC and HAGGISGAC that exploit short supports, while being much simpler. When a constraint is amenable to short supports, the short support set can be exponentially smaller than the full-length support set. Therefore SHORTSTR2 can efficiently propagate many constraints that STR2+ cannot even load into memory. We also show that SHORTSTR2 can be combined with a simple algorithm to identify short supports from full-length supports, to provide a superior drop-in replacement for STR2+."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Hough voting in a geometric transformation space allows us to realize spatial verification, but remains sensitive to feature detection errors because of the inflexible quan-tization of single feature correspondences. To handle this problem, we propose a new method, called adaptive dither voting, for robust spatial verification. For each correspondence , instead of hard-mapping it to a single transformation , the method augments its description by using multiple dithered transformations that are deterministically generated by the other correspondences. The method reduces the probability of losing correspondences during transformation quantization, and provides high robustness as regards mismatches by imposing three geometric constraints on the dithering process. We also propose exploiting the non-uniformity of a Hough histogram as the spatial similarity to handle multiple matching surfaces. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show the superiority of our method. The method outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in both accuracy and scalability, especially when it comes to the retrieval of small, rotated objects."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
In this paper, we explore correlation of  dependency relation paths  to rank candidate answers in  answer extraction . Using the  correlation measure , we compare  dependency relations  of a candidate answer and mapped  question phrases  in  sentence  with the corresponding  relations  in question. Different from previous studies, we propose an  approximate phrase mapping algorithm  and incorporate the  mapping score  into the  correlation measure . The correlations are further incorporated into a  Maximum Entropy-based ranking model  which estimates  path weights  from training. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art  syntactic relation-based methods  by up to 20% in  MRR .

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Scientific Entities Identified:

* categorizing unknown words
Category: Task
Reasoning: This describes the main objective of the system, which is a specific scientific task.

* multi-component architecture
Category: Method
Reasoning: This describes the structure of the system, which is a specific approach to solving the task.

Category: OtherScientificTerm
Reasoning: This is the target of the categorization task, a key concept in the research.

* names
Category: OtherScientificTerm
Reasoning: This is one category of unknown words the system identifies, a specific scientific concept.

* spelling errors
Category: OtherScientificTerm
Reasoning: Another category of unknown words the system identifies, also a specific scientific concept.

* decision tree architecture
Category: Method

* live closed captions
Category: Material
Reasoning: This describes the data used for evaluation, a specific dataset or resource.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD).

Text: " We address appropriate  user modeling  in order to generate  cooperative responses  to each  user  in  spoken dialogue systems  . Unlike previous studies that focus on  user  's  knowledge  or typical kinds of  users  , the  user model  we propose is more comprehensive. Specifically, we set up three dimensions of  user models  :  skill level  to the system,  knowledge level  on the  target domain  and the degree of  hastiness  . Moreover, the  models  are automatically derived by  decision tree learning  using real  dialogue data  collected by the system. We obtained reasonable  classification accuracy  for all dimensions.  Dialogue strategies  based on the  user modeling  are implemented in  Kyoto city bus information system  that has been developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluation shows that the  cooperative responses  adaptive to  individual users  serve as good guidance for  novice users  without increasing the  dialogue duration  for  skilled users  .

Text: "
We consider the problem of  question-focused sentence retrieval  from complex  news articles  describing  multi-event stories published over time .  Annotators  generated a list of  questions  central to understanding each  story  in our  corpus . Because of the dynamic nature of the  stories , many  questions  are time-sensitive (e.g. "How many victims have been found?").  Judges  found  sentences  providing an  answer  to each  question . To address the  sentence retrieval problem , we apply a  stochastic, graph-based method  for comparing the relative importance of the  textual units , which was previously used successfully for  generic summarization . Currently, we present a topic-sensitive version of our  method  and hypothesize that it can outperform a competitive  baseline , which compares the  similarity  of each  sentence  to the input  question  via  IDF-weighted word overlap . In our experiments, the  method  achieves a  TRDR score  that is significantly higher than that of the  baseline .

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "  Sentence planning  is a set of inter-related but distinct tasks, one of which is  sentence scoping  , i.e. the choice of  syntactic structure  for elementary  speech acts  and the decision of how to combine them into one or more  sentences  . In this paper, we present  SPoT  , a  sentence planner  , and a new methodology for automatically training  SPoT  on the basis of  feedback  provided by  human judges  . We reconceptualize the task into two distinct phases. First, a very simple,  randomized sentence-plan-generator (SPG)  generates a potentially large list of possible  sentence plans  for a given  text-plan input  . Second, the  sentence-plan-ranker (SPR)  ranks the list of output  sentence plans  , and then selects the top-ranked  plan  . The  SPR  uses  ranking rules  automatically learned from  training data  . We show that the trained  SPR  learns to select a  sentence plan  whose rating on average is only 5% worse than the  top human-ranked sentence plan  . "

Text: "We study the question of how to make loss-aware predictions in image segmentation settings where the evaluation function is the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) measure that is used widely in evaluating image segmentation systems. Currently, there are two dominant approaches: the first approximates the Expected-IoU (EIoU) score as Expected-Intersection-over-Expected-Union (EIoEU); and the second approach is to compute exact EIoU but only over a small set of high-quality candidate solutions. We begin by asking which approach we should favor for two typical image seg-mentation tasks. Studying this question leads to two new methods that draw ideas from both existing approaches. Our new methods use the EIoEU approximation paired with high quality candidate solutions. Experimentally we show that our new approaches lead to improved performance on both image segmentation tasks."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

Text: "We address the problem of populating object category detection datasets with dense, per-object 3D reconstructions , bootstrapped from class labels, ground truth figure-ground segmentations and a small set of keypoint annotations. Our proposed algorithm first estimates camera viewpoint using rigid structure-from-motion, then reconstructs object shapes by optimizing over visual hull proposals guided by loose within-class shape similarity assumptions. The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions on one of the most challenging existing object-category detection datasets, PASCAL VOC. Our results may re-stimulate once popular geometry-oriented model-based recognition approaches."

Now, apply this process to the following new text and identify at least 5 scientific entities:

Text: "We propose a process model for hierarchical perceptual sound organization, which recognizes perceptual sounds included in incoming sound signals. We consider perceptual sound organization as a scene analysis problem in the auditory domain. Our model consists of multiple processing modules and a hypothesis network for quantitative integration of multiple sources of information. When input information for each processing module is available, the module rises to process it and asynchronously writes output information to the hypothesis network. On the hypothesis network, individual information is integrated and an optimal internal model of perceptual sounds is automatically constructed. Based on the model, a music scene analysis system has been developed for acoustic signals of ensemble music, which recognizes rhythm, chords, and source-separated musical notes. Experimental results show that our method has permitted autonomous, stable and effective information integration to construct the internal model of hierarchical perceptual sounds.

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Scientific Entities Identified:

* categorizing unknown words
Category: Task
Reasoning: This describes the main objective of the system, which is a specific scientific task.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
A major axis of research at LIMSI is directed at  multilingual, speaker-independent, large vocabulary speech dictation . In this paper the  LIMSI recognizer  which was evaluated in the  ARPA NOV93 CSR test  is described, and experimental results on the  WSJ and BREF corpora  under closely matched conditions are reported. For both  corpora   word recognition experiments  were carried out with  vocabularies  containing up to 20k  words . The recognizer makes use of  continuous density HMM  with  Gaussian mixture  for  acoustic modeling  and  n-gram statistics  estimated on the  newspaper texts  for  language modeling . The recognizer uses a  time-synchronous graph-search strategy  which is shown to still be viable with a 20k-word vocabulary when used with  bigram back-off language models . A second  forward pass , which makes use of a  word graph  generated with the  bigram , incorporates a  trigram language model .  Acoustic modeling  uses  cepstrum-based features ,  context-dependent phone models (intra and interword) ,  phone duration models , and  sex-dependent models .

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "This paper describes our work on classification of outdoor scenes. First, images are partitioned into regions using one-class classification and patch-based clustering algorithms where one-class classifiers model the regions with relatively uniform color and texture properties, and clustering of patches aims to detect structures in the remaining regions. Next, the resulting regions are clustered to obtain a codebook of region types, and two models are constructed for scene representation: a " bag of individual regions " representation where each region is regarded separately , and a " bag of region pairs " representation where regions with particular spatial relationships are considered together. Given these representations, scene classification is done using Bayesian classifiers. We also propose a novel region selection algorithm that identifies region types that are frequently found in a particular class of scenes but rarely exist in other classes, and also consistently occur together in the same class of scenes. Experiments on the LabelMe data set showed that the proposed models significantly out-perform a baseline global feature-based approach."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: " 
 This paper describes the understanding process of the  spatial descriptions  in  Japanese  . In order to understand the described  world  , the authors try to reconstruct the geometric model of the global scene from the scenic descriptions drawing a space. It is done by an experimental  computer program   SPRINT  , which takes  natural language texts  and produces a  model  of the described  world  . To reconstruct the  model  , the authors extract the  qualitative spatial constraints  from the  text  , and represent them as the  numerical constraints  on the  spatial attributes  of the  entities  . This makes it possible to express the vagueness of the  spatial concepts  and to derive the maximally plausible interpretation from a chunk of information accumulated as the constraints. The interpretation reflects the  temporary belief  about the  world  . "

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

We propose a framework to derive the  distance  between  concepts  from  distributional measures of word co-occurrences . We use the  categories  in a published  thesaurus  as  coarse-grained concepts , allowing all possible  distance values  to be stored in a  concept-concept matrix  roughly.01% the size of that created by existing measures. We show that the newly proposed  concept-distance measures  outperform  traditional distributional word-distance measures  in the tasks of (1) ranking  word pairs  in order of  semantic distance , and (2) correcting  real-word spelling errors . In the latter task, of all the  WordNet-based measures , only that proposed by Jiang and Conrath outperforms the best  distributional concept-distance measures .

Text: "
Currently several  grammatical formalisms  converge towards being declarative and towards utilizing  context-free phrase-structure grammar  as a backbone, e.g.  LFG  and  PATR-II . Typically the processing of these formalisms is organized within a  chart-parsing framework . The declarative character of the  formalisms  makes it important to decide upon an overall  optimal control strategy  on the part of the processor. In particular, this brings the  rule-invocation strategy  into critical focus: to gain maximal  processing efficiency , one has to determine the best way of putting the  rules  to use. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey and a practical comparison of fundamental  rule-invocation strategies  within  context-free chart parsing .

Text: " 
When people use  natural language  in natural settings, they often use it ungrammatically, missing out or repeating words, breaking-off and restarting, speaking in fragments, etc.. Their  human listeners  are usually able to cope with these deviations with little difficulty. If a  computer system  wishes to accept  natural language input  from its  users  on a routine basis, it must display a similar indifference. In this paper, we outline a set of  parsing flexibilities  that such a system should provide. We go, on to describe  FlexP  , a  bottom-up pattern-matching parser  that we have designed and implemented to provide these flexibilities for  restricted natural language  input to a limited-domain computer system.

Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We address the problem of estimating location information of an image using principles from automated representation learning. We pursue a hierarchical sparse coding approach that learns features useful in discriminating images across locations, by initializing it with a geometric prior corresponding to transformations between image appearance space and their corresponding location grouping space using the notion of parallel transport on manifolds. We then extend this approach to account for the availability of heterogeneous data modalities such as geo-tags and videos pertaining to different locations, and also study a relatively under-addressed problem of transferring knowledge available from certain locations to infer the grouping of data from novel locations. We evaluate our approach on several standard datasets such as im2gps, San Francisco and MediaEval2010, and obtain state-of-the-art results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Many computer vision applications, such as image classification and video indexing, are usually multi-label classification problems in which an instance can be assigned to more than one category. In this paper, we present a novel multi-label classification approach with hypergraph regu-larization that addresses the correlations among different categories. First, a hypergraph is constructed to capture the correlations among different categories, in which each vertex represents one training instance and each hyperedge for one category contains all the instances belonging to the same category. Then, an improved SVM like learning system incorporating the hypergraph regularization, called Rank-HLapSVM, is proposed to handle the multi-label classification problems. We find that the corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the dual coordinate descent method. Many promising experimental results on the real datasets including ImageCLEF and Me-diaMill demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
  Spelling-checkers  have become an integral part of most  text processing software  . From different reasons among which the speed of processing prevails they are usually based on  dictionaries of word forms  instead of  words  . This approach is sufficient for languages with little  inflection  such as  English  , but fails for  highly inflective languages  such as  Czech  ,  Russian  ,  Slovak  or other  Slavonic languages  . We have developed a special method for describing  inflection  for the purpose of building  spelling-checkers  for such languages. The speed of the resulting program lies somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing  spelling-checkers  for  English  and the main  dictionary  fits into the standard  360K floppy  , whereas the number of recognized  word forms  exceeds 6 million (for  Czech  ). Further, a special method has been developed for easy  word classification  . "

Text: "Due to the capacity of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras to simultaneously cover a panoramic area and maintain high resolution imagery, researches in automated surveillance systems with multiple PTZ cameras have become increasingly important. Most existing algorithms require the prior knowledge of intrinsic parameters of the PTZ camera to infer the relative positioning and orientation among multiple PTZ cameras. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mapping algorithm that derives the relative positioning and orientation between two PTZ cameras based on a unified polynomial model. This reduces the dependence on the knowledge of intrinsic parameters of PTZ camera and relative positions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm presents substantially reduced computational complexity and improved flexibility at the cost of slightly decreased pixel accuracy, as compared with the work of Chen and Wang. This slightly decreased pixel accuracy can be compensated by consistent labeling approaches without added cost for the application of automated surveillance systems along with changing configurations and a larger number of PTZ cameras."

Text: "Graphical models such as Bayesian Networks (BNs) are being increasingly applied to various computer vision problems. One bottleneck in using BN is that learning the BN model parameters often requires a large amount of reliable and representative training data, which proves to be difficult to acquire for many computer vision tasks. On the other hand, there is often available qualitative prior knowledge about the model. Such knowledge comes either from domain experts based on their experience or from various physical or geometric constraints that govern the objects we try to model. Unlike the quantitative prior, the qualitative prior is often ignored due to the difficulty of incorporating them into the model learning process. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form solution to systematically combine the limited training data with some generic qualitative knowledge for BN parameter learning. To validate our method, we compare it with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method under sparse data and with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm under incomplete data respectively. To further demonstrate its applications for computer vision, we apply it to learn a BN model for facial Action Unit (AU) recognition from real image data. The experimental results show that with simple and generic qualitative constraints and using only a small amount of training data, our method can robustly and accurately estimate the BN model parameters."

In this paper a  morphological component  with a limited capability to automatically interpret (and generate)  derived words  is presented. The system combines an extended  two-level morphology  [Trost, 1991a; Trost, 1991b] with a  feature-based word grammar  building on a  hierarchical lexicon .  Polymorphemic stems  not explicitly stored in the  lexicon  are given a  compositional interpretation . That way the system allows to minimize redundancy in the  lexicon  because  derived words  that are transparent need not to be stored explicitly. Also,  words formed ad-hoc  can be recognized correctly. The system is implemented in CommonLisp and has been tested on examples from  German derivation .

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper proposes an  alignment adaptation approach  to improve  domain-specific (in-domain) word alignment . The basic idea of  alignment adaptation  is to use  out-of-domain corpus  to improve  in-domain word alignment  results. In this paper, we first train two  statistical word alignment models  with the large-scale  out-of-domain corpus  and the small-scale  in-domain corpus  respectively, and then interpolate these two models to improve the  domain-specific word alignment . Experimental results show that our approach improves  domain-specific word alignment  in terms of both  precision  and  recall , achieving a  relative error rate reduction  of 6.56% as compared with the state-of-the-art technologies.

Text: "
A meaningful evaluation methodology can advance the state-of-the-art by encouraging mature, practical applications rather than "toy" implementations. Evaluation is also crucial to assessing competing claims and identifying promising technical approaches. While work in  speech recognition (SR)  has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of  natural language (NL) interfaces  or researchers in  speech understanding (SU)  to evaluate and compare the systems they developed. Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the  DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program  to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of  SLS systems , and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several  SLS systems . These evaluations are probably the only  NL evaluations  other than the series of  Message Understanding Conferences  (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991). This paper describes a practical  "black-box" methodology  for automatic evaluation of  question-answering NL systems . While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either  speech or text input . The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the  DARPA SLS community , and some problems and directions for future development.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Recently, Stacked Auto-Encoders (SAE) have been successfully used for learning imbalanced datasets. In this paper, for the first time, we propose to use a Neural Network classifier furnished by an SAE structure for detecting the errors made by a strong Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Error detection on an automatic transcription provided by a " strong " ASR system, i.e. exhibiting a small word error rate, is difficult due to the limited number of " positive " examples (i.e. words erroneously recognized) available for training a binary classi-fier. In this paper we investigate and compare different types of classifiers for automatically detecting ASR errors, including the one based on a stacked auto-encoder architecture. We show the effectiveness of the latter by measuring and comparing performance on the automatic transcriptions of an English corpus collected from TED talks. Performance of each investigated classifier is evaluated both via receiving operating curve and via a measure, called mean absolute error, related to the quality in predicting the corresponding word error rate. The results demonstrates that the classifier based on SAE detects the ASR errors better than the other classification methods."

However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

In our method, the estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix that is maintained by it, is updated at each iteration using a sketch of the Hessian, i.e., a randomly generated compressed form of the Hessian. We propose several sketching strategies, present a new quasi-Newton method that uses stochastic block BFGS updates combined with the variance reduction approach SVRG to compute batch stochastic gradients, and prove linear convergence of the resulting method. Numerical tests on large-scale logistic regression problems reveal that our method is more robust and substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."

Text: "This paper investigates critical configurations for projective reconstruction from multiple images taken by a camera moving in a straight line. Projective reconstruction refers to a determination of the 3D geometrical configuration of a set of 3D points and cameras, given only correspondences between points in the images. A configuration of points and cameras is critical if it can not be determined uniquely (up to a projective transform) from the image coordinates of the points. It is shown that a configuration consisting of any number of cameras lying on a straight line, and any number of points lying on a twisted cubic constitutes a critical configuration. An alternative configuration consisting of a set of points and cameras all lying on a rational quartic curve exists."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically predicting  segment boundaries  in  spoken multiparty dialogue  . We extend prior work in two ways. We first apply approaches that have been proposed for  predicting top-level topic shifts  to the problem of  identifying subtopic boundaries  . We then explore the impact on  performance  of using  ASR output  as opposed to  human transcription  . Examination of the effect of  features  shows that  predicting top-level and predicting subtopic boundaries  are two distinct tasks: (1) for predicting  subtopic boundaries  , the  lexical cohesion-based approach  alone can achieve competitive results, (2) for  predicting top-level boundaries  , the  machine learning approach  that combines  lexical-cohesion and conversational features  performs best, and (3)  conversational cues  , such as  cue phrases  and  overlapping speech  , are better indicators for the top-level prediction task. We also find that the  transcription errors  inevitable in  ASR output  have a negative impact on models that combine  lexical-cohesion and conversational features  , but do not change the general preference of approach for the two tasks.

4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "This paper presents a novel statistical singing voice conversion (SVC) technique with direct waveform modification based on the spectrum differential that can convert voice timbre of a source singer into that of a target singer without using a vocoder to generate converted singing voice waveforms. SVC makes it possible to convert singing voice characteristics of an arbitrary source singer into those of an arbitrary target singer. However, speech quality of the converted singing voice is significantly degraded compared to that of a natural singing voice due to various factors, such as analysis and modeling errors in the vocoder-based framework. To alleviate this degradation, we propose a statistical conversion process that directly modifies the signal in the waveform domain by estimating the difference in the spectra of the source and target singers' singing voices. The differential spectral feature is directly estimated using a differential Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that is analytically derived from the traditional GMM used as a conversion model in the conventional SVC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method makes it possible to significantly improve speech quality in the converted singing voice while preserving the conversion accuracy of singer identity compared to the conventional SVC."

Text: "
 Automatic estimation  of  word significance  oriented for  speech-based Information Retrieval (IR)  is addressed. Since the  significance  of  words  differs in  IR ,  automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance  has been evaluated based on  weighted word error rate (WWER) , which gives a  weight  on errors from the viewpoint of  IR , instead of  word error rate (WER) , which treats all  words  uniformly. A  decoding strategy  that minimizes  WWER  based on a  Minimum Bayes-Risk framework  has been shown, and the reduction of errors on both  ASR  and  IR  has been reported. In this paper, we propose an  automatic estimation method  for  word significance (weights)  based on its influence on  IR . Specifically,  weights  are estimated so that  evaluation measures  of  ASR  and  IR  are equivalent. We apply the proposed method to a  speech-based information retrieval system , which is a typical  IR system , and show that the method works well.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. By examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. To further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. Our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes."

We consider the restriction of f to the neighborhood of a multiple intersection point or of infinity, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be locally computable with one hidden layer. We show that adding these conditions to Gib-son's assumptions is not sufficient to ensure global computability with one hidden layer, by exhibiting a new non-local configuration, the "critical cycle", which implies that f is not computable with one hidden layer."

However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "The co-occurrence pattern, a combination of binary or local features, is more discriminative than individual features and has shown its advantages in object, scene, and action recognition. We discuss two types of co-occurrence patterns that are complementary to each other, the conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) of binary features. The necessary condition of identifying discriminative co-occurrence patterns is firstly provided. Then we propose a novel data mining method to efficiently discover the optimal co-occurrence pattern with minimum empirical error, despite the noisy training dataset. This mining procedure of AND and OR patterns is readily integrated to boosting, which improves the generalization ability over the conventional boosting decision trees and boosting decision stumps. Our versatile experiments on object, scene, and action cat-egorization validate the advantages of the discovered dis-criminative co-occurrence patterns."

 English  is shown to be trans-context-free on the basis of  coordinations  of the respectively type that involve  strictly syntactic cross-serial agreement .

The formal proof, which makes crucial use of the  Interchange Lemma  of Ogden et al., is so constructed as to be valid even if  English  is presumed to contain  grammatical sentences  in which respectively operates across a pair of  coordinate phrases  one of whose members has fewer  conjuncts  than the other; it thus goes through whatever the facts may be regarding  constructions  with unequal numbers of  conjuncts  in the  scope  of respectively, whereas other  arguments  have foundered on this problem.

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

Text: " 
 Current  natural language interfaces  have concentrated largely on determining the literal  meaning  of  input  from their  users  . While such  decoding  is an essential underpinning, much recent work suggests that  natural language interfaces  will never appear cooperative or graceful unless they also incorporate numerous  non-literal aspects of communication  , such as robust  communication procedures  . This paper defends that view, but claims that direct imitation of human performance is not the best way to implement many of these  non-literal aspects of communication  ; that the new technology of powerful  personal computers  with integral  graphics displays  offers techniques superior to those of humans for these aspects, while still satisfying  human communication needs  . The paper proposes  interfaces  based on a judicious mixture of these techniques and the still valuable methods of more traditional  natural language interfaces . "

Text: "This paper addresses the problem of optimal alignment of non-rigid surfaces from multi-view video observations to obtain a temporally consistent representation. Conventional non-rigid surface tracking performs frame-to-frame alignment which is subject to the accumulation of errors resulting in a drift over time. Recently, non-sequential tracking approaches have been introduced which reorder the input data based on a dissimilarity measure. One or more input sequences are represented in a tree with reduced alignment path length. They demonstrate a reduced drift and increased robustness to large non-rigid deformations. However, jumps may occur in the aligned mesh sequence where branches of the tree meet due to different error accumulation along them. Optimisation of the tree for non-sequential tracking, which minimises the errors in temporal consistency due to both the drift and the jumps, is proposed. A novel cluster tree enforces sequential tracking in local segments of the sequence while allowing global non-sequential traversal among these segments. This provides a mechanism to create a tree structure which reduces the number and size of jumps between branches and limits the lenght of branches as well. Comprehensive evaluation is performed on a variety of challenging non-rigid surfaces including face, cloth and people. It demonstrates that the proposed cluster tree achieves better temporal consistency than the previous sequential and non-sequential tracking approaches. Quantitative analysis on a created synthetic facial performance also shows an improvement by the cluster tree."

Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we aim to automatically render aging faces in a personalized way. Basically, a set of age-group specific dictionaries are learned, where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from different dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern cross different age groups, and a linear combination of these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging dictionaries, each subject may have extra personalized facial characteristics, e.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular subject, yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups. Thus a personality-aware coupled reconstruction loss is utilized to learn the dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of our proposed solution over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized aging progression, as well as the performance gain for cross-age face verification by synthesizing aging faces."

Text: " 
 Computer programs so far have not fared well in  modeling language acquisition  . For one thing,  learning methodology  applicable in  general domains  does not readily lend itself in the  linguistic domain  . For another,  linguistic representation  used by  language processing systems  is not geared to  learning  . We introduced a new  linguistic representation  , the  Dynamic Hierarchical Phrasal Lexicon (DHPL)  [Zernik88], to facilitate  language acquisition  . From this, a  language learning model  was implemented in the program  RINA  , which enhances its own  lexical hierarchy  by processing examples in context. We identified two tasks: First, how  linguistic concepts  are acquired from  training examples  and organized in a  hierarchy  ; this task was discussed in previous papers [Zernik87]. Second, we show in this paper how a  lexical hierarchy  is used in predicting new  linguistic concepts  . Thus, a  program  does not stall even in the presence of a  lexical unknown  , and a  hypothesis  can be produced for covering that  lexical gap  . "

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "The problem of predicting image or video interestingness from their low-level feature representations has received increasing interest. As a highly subjective visual attribute, annotating the interesting-ness value of training data for learning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation less subjective and more reliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise comparisons – relying on majority voting to prune the annotation outliers/errors. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify annotation outliers by formulating the interestingness prediction task as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier detection and interestingness prediction tasks jointly. Extensive experiments on both image and video interestingness benchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives."

In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

 It is well-known that there are  polysemous words  like  sentence  whose  meaning  or  sense  depends on the context of use. We have recently reported on two new  word-sense disambiguation systems  , one trained on  bilingual material  (the  Canadian Hansards  ) and the other trained on  monolingual material  (  Roget's Thesaurus  and  Grolier's Encyclopedia  ). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong  discourse  effect. That is, if a  polysemous word  such as  sentence  appears two or more times in a  well-written discourse  , it is extremely likely that they will all share the same  sense  . This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share  sense  in the same  discourse  is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of  constraint  for improving the performance of the  word-sense disambiguation algorithm  . In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate  disambiguation algorithms  that did not make use of the  discourse constraint  . "

Text: "In Bayesian machine learning, conjugate priors are popular, mostly due to mathematical convenience. In this paper, we show that there are deeper reasons for choosing a conjugate prior. Specifically, we formulate the conjugate prior in the form of Bregman divergence and show that it is the inherent geometry of conjugate priors that makes them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the effective sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use this geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the hyperparameters and expression of the prior used to couple the generative and discriminative components of a hybrid model for semi-supervised learning."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "The construction of causal graphs from non-experimental data rests on a set of constraints that the graph structure imposes on all probability distributions compatible with the graph. These constraints are of two types: conditional inde-pendencies and algebraic constraints, first noted by Verma. While conditional independencies are well studied and frequently used in causal induction algorithms, Verma constraints are still poorly understood, and rarely applied. In this paper we examine a special subset of Verma constraints which are easy to understand, easy to identify and easy to apply ; they arise from " dormant independencies, " namely, conditional independencies that hold in interventional distributions. We give a complete algorithm for determining if a dormant independence between two sets of variables is entailed by the causal graph, such that this independence is identifiable , in other words if it resides in an interventional distribution that can be predicted without resorting to interventions. We further show the usefulness of dormant independencies in model testing and induction by giving an algorithm that uses constraints entailed by dormant independencies to prune extraneous edges from a given causal graph."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
In this paper, we compare the performance of a state-of-the-art  statistical parser  (Bikel, 2004) in parsing  written and spoken language  and in generating  sub-categorization cues  from  written and spoken language . Although  Bikel's parser  achieves a higher  accuracy  for parsing  written language , it achieves a higher  accuracy  when extracting  subcategorization cues  from  spoken language . Our experiments also show that current technology for  extracting subcategorization frames  initially designed for  written texts  works equally well for  spoken language . Additionally, we explore the utility of  punctuation  in helping  parsing  and  extraction  of  subcategorization cues . Our experiments show that  punctuation  is of little help in parsing  spoken language  and extracting  subcategorization cues  from  spoken language . This indicates that there is no need to add  punctuation  in transcribing  spoken corpora  simply in order to help  parsers .

Text: "Active shape models are a powerful and widely used tool to interpret complex image data. By building models of shape variation they enable search algorithms to use a pri-ori knowledge in an efficient and gainful way. However, due to the linearity of PCA, non-linearities like rotations or independently moving sub-parts in the data can deteriorate the resulting model considerably. Although non-linear extensions of active shape models have been proposed and application specific solutions have been used, they still need a certain amount of user interaction during model building. In this paper the task of build-ing/choosing optimal models is tackled in a more generic information theoretic fashion. In particular, we propose an algorithm based on the minimum description length principle to find an optimal subdivision of the data into sub-parts, each adequate for linear modeling. This results in an overall more compact model configuration. Which in turn leads to a better model in terms of modes of variations. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data, medical images and hand contours."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Conditional Random Field models have proved effective for several low-level computer vision problems. Inference in these models involves solving a combinatorial optimization problem, with methods such as graph cuts, belief propagation. Although several methods have been proposed to learn the model parameters from training data, they suffer from various drawbacks. Learning these parameters involves computing the partition function, which is intractable. To overcome this, state-of-the-art structured learning methods frame the problem as one of large margin estimation. Iterative solutions have been proposed to solve the resulting convex optimization problem. Each iteration involves solving an inference problem over all the labels , which limits the efficiency of these structured methods. In this paper we present an efficient large margin piece-wise learning method which is widely applicable. We show how the resulting optimization problem can be reduced to an equivalent convex problem with a small number of constraints , and solve it using an efficient scheme. Our method is both memory and computationally efficient. We show results on publicly available standard datasets."

Text: "Regression-based techniques have shown promising results for people counting in crowded scenes. However, most existing techniques require expensive and laborious data annotation for model training. In this study, we propose to address this problem from three perspectives: (1) Instead of exhaustively annotating every single frame, the most informative frames are selected for annotation automatically and actively. (2) Rather than learning from only labelled data, the abundant unlabelled data are exploited. (3) Labelled data from other scenes are employed to further alleviate the burden for data annotation. All three ideas are implemented in a unified active and semi-supervised regression framework with ability to perform transfer learning, by exploiting the underlying geometric structure of crowd patterns via manifold analysis. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach."

Text: "Automated facial expression recognition has received increased attention over the past two decades. Existing works in the field usually do not encode either the temporal evolution or the intensity of the observed facial displays. They also fail to jointly model multidimensional (multi-class) continuous facial behaviour data; binary classifiers-one for each target basic-emotion class-are used instead. In this paper, intrinsic topology of multidimensional continuous facial affect data is first modeled by an ordinal man-ifold. This topology is then incorporated into the Hidden Conditional Ordinal Random Field (H-CORF) framework for dynamic ordinal regression by constraining H-CORF parameters to lie on the ordinal manifold. The resulting model attains simultaneous dynamic recognition and intensity estimation of facial expressions of multiple emotions. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first one to achieve this on both deliberate as well as spontaneous facial affect data."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "
We describe an implementation of data-driven selection of emphatic facial displays for an  embodied conversational agent  in a  dialogue system . A  corpus of sentences  in the domain of the  target dialogue system  was recorded, and the facial displays used by the  speaker  were annotated. The data from those recordings was used in a range of models for generating facial displays, each model making use of a different amount of  context  or choosing displays differently within a  context . The models were evaluated in two ways: by  cross-validation  against the  corpus , and by asking users to rate the output. The predictions of the  cross-validation  study differed from the actual user ratings. While the  cross-validation  gave the highest scores to models making a majority choice within a context, the user study showed a significant preference for models that produced more variation. This preference was especially strong among the female subjects.

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading.

Text: "In this paper, we develop a geometric framework for linear or nonlinear discriminant subspace learning and classification. In our framework, the structures of classes are conceptualized as a semi-Riemannian manifold which is considered as a submanifold embedded in an ambient semi-Riemannian space. The class structures of original samples can be characterized and deformed by local metrics of the semi-Riemannian space. Semi-Riemannian metrics are uniquely determined by the smoothing of discrete functions and the nullity of the semi-Riemannian space. Based on the geometrization of class structures, optimizing class structures in the feature space is equivalent to maximizing the quadratic quantities of metric tensors in the semi-Riemannian space. Thus supervised discriminant subspace learning reduces to unsupervised semi-Riemannian mani-fold learning. Based on the proposed framework, a novel algorithm, dubbed as Semi-Riemannian Discriminant Analysis (SRDA), is presented for subspace-based classification. The performance of SRDA is tested on face recognition (singular case) and handwritten capital letter classification (nonsingular case) against existing algorithms. The experimental results show that SRDA works well on recognition and classification, implying that semi-Riemannian geometry is a promising new tool for pattern recognition and machine learning."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "
This paper describes a particular approach to  parsing  that utilizes recent advances in  unification-based parsing  and in  classification-based knowledge representation . As  unification-based grammatical frameworks  are extended to handle richer descriptions of  linguistic information , they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in  KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems . This commonality suggests that some of the  classification-based representation techniques  can be applied to  unification-based linguistic descriptions . This merging supports the integration of  semantic and syntactic information  into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more  efficient parsing  due to the increased organization of knowledge. The use of a  KL-ONE style representation  for  parsing  and  semantic interpretation  was first explored in the  PSI-KLONE system  [2], in which  parsing  is characterized as an inference process called  incremental description refinement .

Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word.

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
 Automatic  evaluation metrics  for  Machine Translation (MT) systems  , such as  BLEU  or  NIST  , are now well established. Yet, they are scarcely used for the assessment of  language pairs  like  English-Chinese  or  English-Japanese  , because of the  word segmentation problem  . This study establishes the equivalence between the standard use of  BLEU  in  word n-grams  and its application at the  character  level. The use of  BLEU  at the  character  level eliminates the  word segmentation problem  : it makes it possible to directly compare commercial systems outputting  unsegmented texts  with, for instance,  statistical MT systems  which usually segment their  outputs  .

Text: "Conventional HMMs have weak duration constraints. In noisy conditions, the mismatch between corrupted speech signals and models trained on clean speech may cause the decoder to produce word matches with unrealistic durations. This paper presents a simple way to incorporate word duration constraints by unrolling HMMs to form a lattice where word duration probabilities can be applied directly to state transitions. The expanded HMMs are compatible with conventional Viterbi decoding. Experiments on connected-digit recognition show that when using explicit duration constraints the decoder generates word matches with more reasonable durations, and word error rates are significantly reduced across a broad range of noise conditions ."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "Uncertainty handling plays an important role during shape tracking. We have recently shown that the fusion of measurement information with system dynamics and shape priors greatly improves the tracking performance for very noisy images such as ultrasound sequences [22]. Nevertheless , this approach required user initialization of the tracking process. This paper solves the automatic initial-ization problem by performing boosted shape detection as a generic measurement process and integrating it in our tracking framework. We show how to propagate the local detection uncertainties of multiple shape candidates during shape alignment, fusion with the predicted shape prior, and fusion with subspace constraints. As a result, we treat all sources of information in a unified way and derive the posterior shape model as the shape with the maximum likelihood. Our framework is applied for the automatic tracking of endocardium in ultrasound sequences of the human heart. Reliable detection and robust tracking results are achieved when compared to existing approaches and inter-expert variations."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
 In this paper we study a set of problems that are of considerable importance to  Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)  but which have not been addressed satisfactorily by the  SMT research community  . Over the last decade, a variety of  SMT algorithms  have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the  computational complexity  of some of the fundamental problems of  SMT  . Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the  computational complexity  of those problems. We prove that while  IBM Models 1-2  are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful)  models  are  hard  . Since it is unlikely that there exists a  polynomial time solution  for any of these  hard problems  (unless  P = NP  and  P#P = P  ), our results highlight and justify the need for developing  polynomial time approximations  for these computations. We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with  complexity  . "

Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

Text: "
This study presents a  method to automatically acquire paraphrases  using  bilingual corpora , which utilizes the  bilingual dependency relations  obtained by projecting a  monolingual dependency parse  onto the other language sentence based on  statistical alignment techniques . Since the  paraphrasing method  is capable of clearly disambiguating the  sense  of an original  phrase  using the  bilingual context  of  dependency relation , it would be possible to obtain interchangeable  paraphrases  under a given  context . Also, we provide an advanced method to acquire  generalized translation knowledge  using the extracted  paraphrases . We applied the method to acquire the  generalized translation knowledge  for  Korean-English translation . Through experiments with  parallel corpora  of a  Korean and English language pairs , we show that our  paraphrasing method  effectively extracts  paraphrases  with high  precision , 94.3% and 84.6% respectively for  Korean  and  English , and the  translation knowledge  extracted from the  bilingual corpora  could be generalized successfully using the  paraphrases  with the 12.5%  compression ratio .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "This paper presents a method for blind estimation of reverberation times in reverberant enclosures. The proposed algorithm is based on a statistical model of short-term log-energy sequences for echo-free speech. Given a speech utterance recorded in a reverberant room, it computes a Maximum Likelihood estimate of the room full-band reverberation time. The estimation method is shown to require little data and to perform satisfactorily. The method has been successfully applied to robust automatic speech recognition in reverberant environments by model selection. For this application, the reverberation time is first estimated from the reverberated speech utterance to be recognized. The estimation is then used to select the best acoustic model out of a library of models trained in various artificial re-verberant conditions. Speech recognition experiments in simulated and real reverberant environments show the efficiency of our approach which outperforms standard channel normaliza-tion techniques."

Text: "
The present paper reports on a preparatory research for building a  language corpus annotation scenario  capturing the  discourse relations  in  Czech . We primarily focus on the description of the  syntactically motivated relations  in  discourse , basing our findings on the theoretical background of the  Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0  and the  Penn Discourse Treebank 2 . Our aim is to revisit the present-day  syntactico-semantic (tectogrammatical) annotation  in the  Prague Dependency Treebank , extend it for the purposes of a  sentence-boundary-crossing representation  and eventually to design a new,  discourse level  of  annotation . In this paper, we propose a feasible process of such a transfer, comparing the possibilities the  Praguian dependency-based approach  offers with the  Penn discourse annotation  based primarily on the analysis and classification of  discourse connectives .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In this paper, we propose a partially-blurred-image classification and analysis framework for automatically detecting images containing blurred regions and recognizing the blur types for those regions without needing to perform blur kernel estimation and image deblurring. We develop several blur features modeled by image color, gradient, and spectrum information, and use feature parameter training to robustly classify blurred images. Our blur detection is based on image patches, making region-wise training and classification in one image efficient. Extensive experiments show that our method works satisfactorily on challenging image data, which establishes a technical foundation for solving several computer vision problems, such as motion analysis and image restoration, using the blur information."

Text: "
This paper presents an  evaluation method  employing a  latent variable model  for  paraphrases  with their  contexts . We assume that the  context  of a  sentence  is indicated by a  latent variable  of the  model  as a  topic  and that the  likelihood  of each  variable  can be inferred. A  paraphrase  is evaluated for whether its  sentences  are used in the same  context . Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves almost 60%  accuracy  and that there is not a large performance difference between the two  models . The results also revealed an upper bound of  accuracy  of 77% with the  method  when using only  topic information .

Previous change detection methods, focusing on detecting large-scale significant changes, cannot do this well. This paper proposes a feasible end-to-end approach to this challenging problem. We start from active camera relocation that quickly relocates camera to nearly the same pose and position of the last time observation. To guarantee detection sensitivity and accuracy of minute changes, in an observation, we capture a group of images under multiple illuminations, which need only to be roughly aligned to the last time lighting conditions. Given two times observations, we formulate fine-grained change detection as a joint optimization problem of three related factors, i.e., normal-aware lighting difference, camera geometry correction flow, and real scene change mask. We solve the three factors in a coarse-to-fine manner and achieve reliable change decision by rank minimization. We build three real-world datasets to benchmark fine-grained change detection of misaligned scenes under varied multiple lighting conditions. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art change detection methods and its ability to distinguish real scene changes from false ones caused by lighting variations."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution.

Text: "Learning video representation is not a trivial task, as video is an information-intensive media where each frame does not exist independently. Locally, a video frame is visually and semantically similar with its adjacent frames. Holistically, a video has its inherent structure—the correlations among video frames. For example, even the frames far from each other may also hold similar semantics. Such context information is therefore important to characterize the intrinsic representation of a video frame. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn the deep video representation by exploring both local and holistic contexts. Specifically, we propose a triplet sampling mechanism to encode the local temporal relationship of adjacent frames based on their deep representations. In addition, we incorporate the graph structure of the video, as a priori, to holistically preserve the inherent correlations among video frames. Our approach is fully unsupervised and trained in an end-to-end deep convolutional neu-ral network architecture. By extensive experiments, we show that our learned representation can significantly boost several video recognition tasks (retrieval , classification, and highlight detection) over traditional video representations."

Text: "
An extension to the  GPSG grammatical formalism  is proposed, allowing  non-terminals  to consist of finite sequences of  category labels , and allowing  schematic variables  to range over such sequences. The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate  grammar  for  crossed serial dependencies , as found in e.g.  Dutch subordinate clauses . The structures induced for such  constructions  are argued to be more appropriate to data involving  conjunction  than some previous proposals have been. The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing  parsing method  for  GPSG . "

Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "We attack an inexplicably under-explored language genre of spoken language—lyrics in music—via completely unsuper-vised induction of an SMT-style stochastic transduction grammar for hip hop lyrics, yielding a fully-automatically learned challenge-response system that produces rhyming lyrics given an input. Unlike previous efforts, we choose the domain of hip hop lyrics, which is particularly unstructured and noisy. A novel feature of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori linguistic or phonetic knowledge. In spite of the level of difficulty of the challenge, the model nevertheless produces fluent output as judged by human evaluators, and performs significantly better than widely used phrase-based SMT models upon the same task."

Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

We focus on the problem of building large  repositories  of  lexical conceptual structure (LCS) representations  for  verbs  in multiple  languages . One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relation between  broad semantic classes  and  LCS meaning components . Our  acquisition program - LEXICALL -  takes, as input, the result of previous work on  verb classification  and  thematic grid tagging , and outputs  LCS representations  for different  languages . These  representations  have been ported into  English, Arabic and Spanish lexicons , each containing approximately 9000  verbs . We are currently using these  lexicons  in an  operational foreign language tutoring  and  machine translation .

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "This paper presents an approach to localizing functional objects in surveillance videos without domain knowledge about semantic object classes that may appear in the scene. Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they " attract " people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or " repel " people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as " dark matter " , emanating " dark energy " that affects people's trajectories in the video. To detect " dark matter " and infer their " dark energy " field, we extend the La-grangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach " dark matter " and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite " dark energy " field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended " dark matter " while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people's trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people's trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage."

You are an expert in natural language processing and scientific text analysis. Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.
3. For each entity, provide a category and reasoning.
4. Use only these categories: Task, Method, Metric, Material, OtherScientificTerm
5. Use the following format for each entity:
   * Entity Name
     Category: [Category]
     Reasoning: [Reasoning]

Here are two examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "This paper introduces a system for categorizing unknown words. The system is based on a multi-component architecture where each component is responsible for identifying one class of unknown words. The focus of this paper is the components that identify names and spelling errors. Each component uses a decision tree architecture to combine multiple types of evidence about the unknown word. The system is evaluated using data from live closed captions - a genre replete with a wide variety of unknown words."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

xample 3:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: "In the security domain a key problem is identifying rare behaviours of interest.

We present a novel weakly supervised algorithm that can detect behaviours that either have never before been seen or for which there are few examples. Global context is modelled, allowing the detection of abnormal behaviours that in isolation appear normal. Pragmatic aspects are considered, such that no parameter tuning is required and real time performance is achieved."

Now, apply this process to the following new text and identify at least 5 scientific entities:

Text: "High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptic brain tissue and activity. HFOs additionally serve as a prototypical example of challenges in the analysis of discrete events in high-temporal resolution, intracranial EEG data. Two primary challenges are 1) dimensionality reduction, and 2) assessing feasibility of classification. Dimensionality reduction assumes that the data lie on a manifold with dimension less than that of the features space. However, previous HFO analysis have assumed a linear manifold, global across time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual patients. Instead, we assess both a) whether linear methods are appropriate and b) the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We also estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the distinction between two classes of HFOs (those occurring during seizures and those occurring due to other processes). This analysis provides the foundation for future clinical use of HFO features and guides the analysis for other discrete events, such as individual action potentials or multi-unit activity."
