Your task is to extract and categorize scientific entities from the given text. Please follow these steps carefully:
1. Read the given text carefully.
2. Identify and list all relevant scientific entities found in the text. The number of entities may vary depending on the content.

Here are the fewshot examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

This paper presents a new approach to  statistical sentence generation  in which alternative  phrases  are represented as packed sets of  trees, or  forests, and then ranked statistically to choose the best one. This representation offers advantages in compactness and in the ability to represent  syntactic information. It also facilitates more efficient  statistical ranking  than a previous approach to  statistical generation. An efficient  ranking algorithm  is described, together with experimental results showing significant improvements over simple enumeration or a  lattice-based approach.

Note that in the above examples, some of the identified scientific entities may not have a clear-cut category or reasoning, as they are not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on your understanding of the scientific context, you can infer the category and reasoning for these entities. For example, in the first example, "local shapes" could be categorized as an "OtherScientificTerm" since it is not explicitly mentioned as a task, method, metric, or material. Similarly, in the second example, "execution-contingent" could be categorized as a "Method" since it is a specific approach to designing rules. In general, you should use your scientific knowledge and understanding to categorize and reason about the scientific entities in the text.

Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "
A meaningful evaluation methodology can advance the state-of-the-art by encouraging mature, practical applications rather than "toy" implementations. Evaluation is also crucial to assessing competing claims and identifying promising technical approaches. While work in  speech recognition (SR)  has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of  natural language (NL) interfaces  or researchers in  speech understanding (SU)  to evaluate and compare the systems they developed. Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the  DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program  to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of  SLS systems, and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several  SLS systems. These evaluations are probably the only  NL evaluations  other than the series of  Message Understanding Conferences  (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991). This paper describes a practical  "black-box" methodology  for automatic evaluation of  question-answering NL systems. While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either  speech or text input. The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the  DARPA SLS community, and some problems and directions for future development.

Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Text: " 
 It is often assumed that when  natural language processing  meets the real world, the ideal of aiming for complete and correct interpretations has to be abandoned. However, our experience with  TACITUS  ; especially in the  MUC-3 evaluation , has shown that principled techniques for  syntactic and pragmatic analysis  can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making  syntactic analysis  more robust---an  agenda-based scheduling parser , a  recovery technique for failed parses , and a new technique called  terminal substring parsing . For  pragmatics processing , we describe how the method of  abductive inference  is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required  world knowledge , performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented. "

Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: " 
 We present an efficient algorithm for  chart-based phrase structure parsing  of  natural language  that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from  unrestricted texts  where many of the  words  are unknown and much of the  text  is irrelevant to the task. The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced.
