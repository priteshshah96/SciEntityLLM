Here are the fewshot examples demonstrating this process:

Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Now, apply this process to the following new text and identify all the scientific entities:

Text: "We propose a novel approach to associate objects across multiple PTZ cameras that can be used to perform camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios. While previous approaches relied on geometric, appearance, or correlation-based information for establishing correspondences between static cameras, they each have well-known limitations and are not extendable to wide-area settings with PTZ cameras. In our approach, the slave camera only passively follows the target (by loose registration with the master) and bootstraps itself from its own incoming imagery, thus effectively circumventing the problems faced by previous approaches and avoiding the need to perform any model transfer. Towards this goal, we also propose a novel Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) formulation for the problem based on the logistic softmax function of covariance-based region features within a MAP estimation framework. We demonstrate our approach with multiple PTZ camera sequences in typical outdoor surveillance settings and show a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches."
