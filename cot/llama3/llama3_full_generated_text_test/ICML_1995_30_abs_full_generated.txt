Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "In this paper we introduce Ant-Q, a family of algorithms which present many similarities with Q-learning (Watkins, 1989), and which we apply to the solution of symmetric and asym-metric instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Ant-Q algorithms were inspired by work on the ant system (AS), a distributed algorithm for combinatorial optimization based on the metaphor of ant colonies which was recently proposed in (Dorigo, 1992; Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1996). We show that AS is a particular instance of the Ant-Q family, and that there are instances of this family which perform better than AS. We experimentally investigate the functioning of Ant-Q and we show that the results obtained by Ant-Q on symmetric TSP's are competitive with those obtained by other heuristic approaches based on neural networks or local search. Finally, we apply Ant-Q to some difficult asymmetric TSP's obtaining very good results: Ant-Q was able to find solutions of a quality which usually can be found only by very specialized algorithms."
