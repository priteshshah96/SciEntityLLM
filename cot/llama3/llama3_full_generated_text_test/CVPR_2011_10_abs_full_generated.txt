Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "Reflections in image sequences consist of several layers superimposed over each other. This phenomenon causes many image processing techniques to fail as they assume the presence of only one layer at each examined site e.g. motion estimation and object recognition. This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points. It models reflection as regions containing two different layers moving over each other. We present a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors. We use novel priors, generate sparse and dense detection maps and our results show high detection rate with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion."
