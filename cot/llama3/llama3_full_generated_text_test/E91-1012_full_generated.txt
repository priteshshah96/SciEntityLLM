Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "
A purely functional implementation of  LR-parsers  is given, together with a simple  correctness proof. It is presented as a generalization of the  recursive descent parser. For  non-LR grammars  the time-complexity of our  parser  is cubic if the functions that constitute the  parser  are implemented as  memo-functions, i.e. functions that memorize the results of previous invocations.  Memo-functions  also facilitate a simple way to construct a very compact representation of the  parse forest. For  LR(0) grammars, our algorithm is closely related to the  recursive ascent parsers  recently discovered by Kruse-man Aretz [1] and Roberts [2].  Extended CF grammars  ( grammars  with  regular expressions  at the right hand side) can be parsed with a simple modification of the  LR-parser  for normal  CF grammars.

Example 4:
Text: "This paper proposes a framework for the extraction of keyphrases from text. The framework consists of two components: a keyphrase extractor, and a keyphrase classifier. The keyphrase extractor identifies all keyphrases in the text, while the classifier assigns a confidence score to each keyphrase. We define a confidence score as the probability that a keyphrase is a keyphrase. The keyphrases are extracted using a simple technique based on the occurrence of words in the text. The classifier is a linear model that uses word features to predict the confidence score of a keyphrase. We evaluated our framework on a corpus of 100 research papers in the field of information retrieval. The results show that our framework can achieve an F-measure of 0.6, which is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques."
