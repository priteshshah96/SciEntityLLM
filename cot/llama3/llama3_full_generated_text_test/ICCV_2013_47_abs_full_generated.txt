Example 1:
Text: "A " graphics for vision " approach is proposed to address the problem of reconstruction from a large and imperfect data set: reconstruction on demand by tensor voting, or ROD-TV. ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail, by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood. We compare our approach and present encouraging results."

Example 2:
Text: "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are "execution-contingent," i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules."

Text: "Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field super-resolution. We show that the light field space is largely bi-linear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct tri-angulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graph-cut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality."

Example 4:
Text: "The paper presents an approach to improve the performance of state-of-the-art 3D object detection networks in autonomous driving. We focus on two major challenges of existing detection methods: (1) the poor performance of the detection networks on small objects; and (2) the difficulty of localizing objects in the image due to occlusion. We propose a novel 3D object detector that addresses both challenges by exploiting the contextual information of the object and the occlusion-aware image feature extraction. Specifically, the proposed method learns the context of each object and then refines the bounding boxes and the confidence scores of the objects. In addition, we introduce a new image feature extraction method that can effectively deal with occlusions. We evaluate the proposed method on two autonomous driving datasets: KITTI and NuScenes. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets."

TOBOM models the object trajectory as a sequence of 2D position measurements in the image plane, with each measurement corresponding to a single object detection. The model uses a Gaussian process to represent the object motion, and a Bayesian filtering algorithm to estimate the object trajectory. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset, and compare it to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in both accuracy and robustness to noise and occlusions."
