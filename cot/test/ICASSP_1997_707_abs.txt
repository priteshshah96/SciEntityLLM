Nonstationary chaotic behavior is not an oxymoron. We present two methods for capturing nonstationary chaos, then present a few examples including biological signals, ocean waves and traffic flow. The issue is of practical interest because it is often useful to capture when nonstationary events take place and it is desirable to know over what periods a signal is stationary.
