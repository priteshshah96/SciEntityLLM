Currently, N-gram models are the most common and widely used models for statistical language modeling. In this paper, we investigated an alternative way to build language models, i.e., using artificial neural networks to learn the language model. Our experiment result shows that the neural network can learn a language model that has performance even better than standard statistical methods.
