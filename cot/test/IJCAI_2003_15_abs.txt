Many description logics (DLs) combine knowledge representation on an abstract, logical level with an interface to "concrete" domains such as numbers and strings. We propose to extend such DLs with key constraints that allow the expression of statements like "US citizens are uniquely identified by their social security number". Based on this idea, we introduce a number of natural description logics and present (un)decidability results and tight NEx-PTlME complexity bounds.
