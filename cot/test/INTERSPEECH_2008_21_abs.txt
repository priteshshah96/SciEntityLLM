This paper presents a research on the Czech talking head system. It gives an overview of methods used for visual speech animation, parameterization of a human face and a tongue, necessary data sources and a synthesis method. A 3D animation model is used for a pseudo-muscular animation schema to create such animation of visual speech which is usable for a lipreading. An extension of animation schema is presented to reach more precise deformations mainly in a lip area. Furthermore , a problem of forming articulatory trajectories is formulated to solve labial coarticulation effects. It is used for the synthesis method based on a selection of articulatory targets and interpolation technique.
