LPC based speech coders operating at bit rates below 3.0 kbits/sec are usually associated with buzzy or metallic artefacts in the synthetic speech. These are mainly attributable to the simplifying assumptions made about the excitation source, which are usually required to maintain such low bit rates. In this paper a new LPC vocoder is presented which splits the LPC excitation into two frequency bands using a variable cutoff frequency. The lower band is responsible for representing the voiced parts of speech, whilst the upper band represents unvoiced speech. In doing so the coder's performance during both mixed voicing speech and speech containing acoustic noise is greatly improved, producing soft natural sounding speech. The paper also describes new parameter determination and quantisation techniques vital to the operation of this coder at such low bit rates.
