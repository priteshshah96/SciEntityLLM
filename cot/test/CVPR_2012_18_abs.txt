We propose a novel technique called bispectral photo-metric stereo that makes effective use of fluorescence for shape reconstruction. Fluorescence is a common phenomenon occurring in many objects from natural gems and corals, to fluorescent dyes used in clothing. One of the important characteristics of fluorescence is its wavelength-shifting behavior: fluorescent materials absorb light at a certain wavelength and then reemit it at longer wavelengths. Due to the complexity of its emission process, fluo-rescence tends to be excluded from most algorithms in computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we show that there is a strong similarity between fluorescence and ideal diffuse reflection and that fluorescence can provide distinct clues on how to estimate an object's shape. Moreover , fluorescence's wavelength-shifting property enables us to estimate the shape of an object by applying photomet-ric stereo to emission-only images without suffering from specular reflection. This is the significant advantage of the fluorescence-based method over previous methods based on reflection.
